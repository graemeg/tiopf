In this demo, we build a simple address book application (the object model design is shown on tiOPF web site)

The demo focuses on creating a robust object model.

Data is persisted to a Firebird database (with IBX), an XMLLight database and  with the remote persistence layer to an application server.

The demo includes:

a) Database create scripts;
b) Sample XMLLight file;
c) Modal forms client - that connects
     i) directly to firebird;
     ii) directly to XMLLight;
     iii) to a firebird database via an application server;
d) Command line client;
e) Browser based HTML client;
f) Application server;
g) An example of the tiOPF remote deployment framework
h) Unit tests;
i) Build & install scripts

ToDo: 

a) Implement demos for 
     Model-GUI-Mediator
     Application Menu System
     Data aware controls
      
b) Implement demos for
     Database independent visitors
     Hard coded visitors
