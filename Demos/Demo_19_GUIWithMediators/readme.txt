
  This is a simple little demo showing how to use tiMediator and tiFormMediator

Features:
 * using only standard controls
 * Value boundries 
     - Age between 1-100
     - Name max length of 25
 * One custom mediator for read-only support
 * Two components observing the same property (Age)


Other features that could be added is better validation on edtAge etc, but
I'll leave that up to you to experiment with.
