<h4>Acknowledgment</h4>

<p>The TUtilsCustomInputStream and TUtilsCustomOutputStream classes are based on code written by Robert Marquardt.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The Parser Utilities Library contains general classes for parsing a byte stream. The latest version of this software is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.philo.de/xml/">http://www.philo.de/xml/</a>&gt;.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Using the unit</h4>

<p>The Tree Utilities Library does not contain any components to be registered. So using it from inside your own projects is very simple: Add "dkParserUtils" to the uses clause of your unit and make sure that the path to the location of the dkParserUtils.pas file is included in Delphi's list of library paths. To include it go to the Library section of Delphi's Environment Options dialog (see the menu item: "Tools/Environment Options ...").</p>

      InitialLine: Int64);</h6>

<p>Constructs and initializes an instance of TUtilsInputSource with the specified Stream.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream<br />The TStream object which gives access to the source to be processed.</li>
<li>ABufSize<br />The size of the buffer. The value should be a multiplicity of 1024.</li>
<li>AEncoding<br />The encoding for the stream if known, or an empty string if unkown. If no encoding had been specified, the effective encoding is determined with the help of the input stream's byte order mark or set to the default UTF-8 encoding, if no byte order mark was found.</li>
<li>InitialByteCount<br />The initial value to calculate the ByteCount field of the ...CharInfo properties. For a stream with no offset this value is '0'.</li>
<li>InitialCharCount<br />The initial value to calculate the CharCount field of the ...CharInfo properties. For a stream with no offset this value is '0'.</li>
<li>InitialCharsInLine<br />The initial value to calculate the CharsInLine field of the ...CharInfo properties. For a stream with no offset this value is '0'.</li>
<li>InitialTabsInLine<br />The initial value to calculate the TabsInLine field of the ...CharInfo properties. For a stream with no offset this value is '0'.</li>
<li>InitialLine<br />The initial value to calculate the Line field of the ...CharInfo properties. For a stream with no offset this value is '1'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>EConvertError<br />Raised if the specified ACodecClass is TUCS2Codec or TUTF16BECodec but an UTF-16LE byte order mark had been detected or if the specified ACodecClass is TUTF16LECodec but an UTF-16BE byte order mark had been detected, or raised if the source stream's first character (if any) cannot be converted from the specified encoding to a UCS-4 code point.</li>
</ul>

<h6>function Match(Ucs2Str: WideString): Boolean; virtual;</h6>

<p>Advances the current code point as far as the following content of the input stream matches the specified WideString. After calling Match, if the specified WideString completely matched the following content of the input stream, the position of the current code point is that of the last matched character. If the following content of the input stream did not completely match the specified WideString, the position of the current code point after calling Match is that of the first mismatched character.</p>

<p>Hint: If the input stream contains a character of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the TUtilsInputSource object cannot advance the current character beyond this character. The Match function may nevertheless test for STRING TERMINATOR which must appear at the end of the specified wideString in order to get a chance for a positive result.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ucs2Str<br />A UCS-2 encoded WideString to be matched.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return Value:</p>
<ul>
<li>'True' if the specified wideString completely matched the following content of the input stream, 'False' otherwise.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h6>procedure Next; virtual;</h6>

<p>Advances the current character to the next character (if any) of the input stream. If the code point of the current character is $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) calling Next has no effect. If the end of the input stream is reached the code point of the current character is set to $9C (STRING TERMINATOR).</p>

<p>Hint: If the input stream contains a character of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the TUtilsInputSource object cannot advance the current character beyond this character. Note also that if the value of the current character is $9C the code point returned by the NextChar property is always $9C no matter whether the end of the input stream was reached or not.</p>

<p>Exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>EConvertError<br />Raised if the next character of the source stream cannot be converted (according to the current character encoding scheme) to a UCS-4 code point.</li>
</ul>

<h6>procedure Reset; virtual;</h6>

<p>Resets the input source to its initial position and state.</p>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

</ul>

<h6>function SkipNext(Ucs2Str: WideString): Integer; virtual;</h6>

<p>Advances the current character to the next character (if any) of the input stream while skipping any UCS-2 character contained in Ucs2Str. If the code point of the current character is $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) calling SkipNext has no effect. If the end of the input stream is reached the code point of the current character is set to $9C (STRING TERMINATOR).</p>

<p>Hint: If the input stream contains a character of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the TUtilsInputSource object cannot advance the current character beyond this character. Including $9C in the Ucs2Str parameter has no effect. Note also that if the value of the current character is $9C the code point returned by the NextChar property is always $9C no matter whether the end of the input stream was reached or not.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ucs2Str<br />A UCS-2 encoded WideString containing all the characters to be skipped. Repeating a character should be avoided if performance is important. Including STRING TERMINATOR ($9C) in the list of characters to be skipped has no effect, i.e. STRING TERMINATOR appearing in the input stream always terminates SkipNext.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return Value:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of characters skipped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>EConvertError<br />Raised if the next character of the source stream cannot be converted (according to the current character encoding scheme) to a UCS-4 code point.</li>

<h4>TUtilsCustomTranscoder = class</h4>

<p>Use TUtilsCustomTranscoder is the abstract base class for transcoder classes.  It provides basic methods to transcode a sequence of characters from one encoding to another.  Do not use instances of TUtilsCustomTranscoder directly in your application. Instead use one of the classes derived from TUtilsCustomTranscoder.</p>

<h6>Busy: Boolean (readonly)</h6>

<p>Returns 'True' during a transcoding session, otherwise 'False'.</p>

<h6>InputCodec: TUnicodeCodec (readonly)</h6>

<p>Returns the codec class corresponding to the character encoding scheme of the input events.</p>

<h6>InputEncoding: string</h6>

<p>The event handler for the OnRead event of an internal TUnicodeCodec object. This codec object requests byte values to be transcoded during a transcoding session, similar to the Delphi VCL TStream.read function. By default the CodecReadEventHandler procedure returns 'False' in the Ok parameter and does not write input byte values to the Buf parameter. Derived classes should override this procedure to provide input byte values.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender: TObject<br />The object whose event handler is called.</li>
<li>var Buf<br />The buffer for the next input byte values.</li>

<h6>procedure Transcode; virtual;</h6>

<p>Performs a transcoding session. Line breaks are normalized according to the value of the LineBreakOpt property. During a transcoding session the TUtilsCustomTranscoder object requests input bytes through its protected CodecReadEventHandler procedure and provides output bytes through its protected CodecWriteEventHandler procedure. After each individual character transcoding an OnProgress event is triggert.</p>

<p>Derived classes should override the CodecReadEventHandler and CodecWriteEventHandler procedures to provide input byte values and to process output byte values.</p>

<p>A transcoding session terminates, if an OnRead event either returns 'False' in its 'Ok' parameter or returns a byte (or byte sequence) representing the equivalent of the Unicode character STRING TERMINATOR (Unicode code point: $9C).
