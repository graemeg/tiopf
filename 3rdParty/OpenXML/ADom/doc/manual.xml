<title>Preface</title>

<para>The Alternative Document Object Model (ADOM) provides several classes to represent the logical structure of well-formed XML documents and ways to access and manipulate them. Here, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the Document Object Model may be used to manage this data.</para>

<para>ADOM is a Delphi 5/6/7/8/2005/2006/2007/2009/2010 and Kylix 3 Document Object Model implementation, suitable for Win32 as well as .NET progamming.  It follows the Document Object Model (DOM) specifications provided by the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  There exist three versions of W3C's DOM: the basic DOM Level 1 [DOM 1] and the more advanced DOM Level 2 [DOM 2] and DOM Level 3 [DOM 3]. However, ADOM is not completely following the DOM specifications; therefore its status is that of a non-conforming DOM implementation.  More information about the DOM is available at the W3C's web-site at "http://w3.org".</para>

<para>ADOM implements the full DOM 1, the DOM 2 Core, XML Views and Traversal modules, and its own DTD Model, Parser and XPath modules.  The DOM 2 modifications and additions of DOM 1 are indicated in this manual by a number-sign (#). Where the ADOM implementation deviates from the DOM specifications or where some DOM methods have not been implemented yet, these modifications are indicated by an asterisk (*). The DOM specifications allow additional procedures and functions to improve the functionality of the implementation. This additions are indicated by a plus-sign (+). Due to the wide range of the additions this implementation was named Alternative Document Object Model (ADOM).</para>

<para>The latest version of this Software can be found at "http://www.philo.de/xml/". Please, report unknown bugs in the source code or in this documentation to the author via "d.k@philo.de" (make sure that you refer to the latest ADOM version). For known bugs, please consult the file 'BUGLIST.txt' which accompanies this release of the 'Alternative Document Object Model'. For all other matters, please post to the openxml mailing list. Instructions how to join the mailing list can be found at "http://www.philo.de/xml/" as well.</para>

<title>Overview</title>

  <para></para>

  <sect1>
  <title>Required Packages</title>

  <para>ADOM requires the Open XML Utility Library that is also available from the Open XML Web-site at "http://www.philo.de/xml/". Make sure that the version of the Utility Library is compatible with your ADOM version. It is recommended to either use the latest ADOM release together with the latest Utility Library release or for previous ADOM releases one of the combinations that are approved on the Open XML Web-site.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>Supported XML Version</title>

  <para>ADOM supports XML 1.0, according to the fifth edition of the [XML 1.0] specification as of 26 November 2008. XML 1.1 is currently not supported.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>Operating System Differences</title>

  <para>The TDomToXmlParser.UseActiveCodePage functionality is not available in Kylix. It is also not available in Delphi for .NET if the required Open XML Utility Library has been compiled with the ALL_OS coditional symbol defined. Compiling the Utility Library with the ALL_OS coditional symbol allows to execute ADOM on other RTL environments than Windows-.NET (for example on Mono under Linux or Mac OS).</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>Case Sensitivity in ADOM</title>

  <para>ADOM includes many methods that imply string matching. XML is explicitly case sensitive. For the purposes of ADOM, string matching takes place on a character code by character code basis, on the 16 bit value of a WideString. As such, ADOM assumes that any normalizations will take place in the application, before the ADOM structure trees are built. However, the XML Parser which is included in ADOM does not verify that the document being processed is in fully normalized form.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>Interface Reference Counting in Delphi for Win32 and ADOM</title>

  <para>Under Delphi for Win32 interfaced objects are usually derived from the TInterfacedObject class. Following the paradigm of Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) this class introduces to Delphi automated garbage collection of interfaced objects. At first glance this seems to be a good idea promissing to redeem us from worries about memory leaks. However, the matter is now worse than before. The TInterfacedObject class created the potential for an even more difficult to detect kind of memory leaks. If the last interface variable pointing to a TInterfacedObject instance goes out of scope, the object is freed, no matter whether a variable to the instance still exists. Source code cannot be checked for such harmful object variables at compile-time. The existence of such a variable might only detected at run-time, when a call to the now out-of-scope variable results in an access violation -- perhaps in a completely different part of the source code than that which introduced the bug. Only debugging threads can be more unpleasant.</para>

  <para>In other words: Using interfaces in combination with the TInterfacedObject class is not consistent with clean software design.</para>

  <para>Therefore, all classes using interfaces in ADOM under Delphi for Win32 do inherit from a non-reference-counted TUtilsNoRefCount base class which implements IUnknown as follows:</para>

  <para>
  <programlisting>
    function TUtilsNoRefCount._AddRef: Integer;
    begin
      Result := -1
    end;

    function TUtilsNoRefCount._Release: Integer;
    begin
      Result := -1
    end;

    function TUtilsNoRefCount.QueryInterface(const IID: TGUID;
      out Obj): HResult;
    begin
      if GetInterface(IID, Obj) then
        Result := 0
      else
        Result := E_NoInterface;
    end;
  </programlisting>
  </para>
  
  <para>Due to the completely different memory management under .NET all of this is irrelevant in Delphi for .NET.</para>

  <para>ADOM operations only raise exceptions in <quote>exceptional</quote> circumstances, i.e. when an operation is impossible to perform (either for logical reasons, because data is lost, or because the implementation has become unstable). In general, ADOM methods raise exceptions in ordinary processing situation, such as out-of-bound errors when using TDomNodeList.</para>

      This event is triggered when an attribute belonging to

      object was changed.  Note that this event is not triggered
      when an attribute was changed which has no owner element.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         This TDomImplementation object that calls the
         event.
      - ModifiedNode
         The TDomElement node whose attribute changed.
      - AttrChange
         Indicates whether the related TDomAttr node was
         modified, added, or removed.  String based replacement
         of an attribute value will be viewed as a modification
         of the TDomAttr node since its identity does not change.

      This event is triggered after character data within a
      node owned by a document created by this TDomImplementation
      object has been modified but the node itself has not been
      inserted or deleted. This event is also triggered by
      modifications to TDomProcessingInstruction nodes.

                  Error: TDomError;
              var Go: Boolean)
            of object;

      This event is called when this TDomImplementation
      object receives an error notification through its
      HandleError method (which might also be triggered
      automatically by some operations such as validating
      a document).
      
      Error events may be temporarily disabled by calling
      the DisableErrorEvents procedure.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The object that called the event.  In case of
         an internal call, this is the implementation
         itself.
      - Error
         The error object that describes the error, this
         object may be reused by the Sender across
         multiple calls to the handleError method.

      Var Parameters:
      - Go
         If 'True' the DomImplementation should continue as
         if the error didn't happen when possible, if the
         method returns 'False' then the DomImplementation
         should stop the current processing when possible.
         The default is 'True' if the value of the 'severity'
         property of 'error' is DOM_SEVERITY_WARNING or
         DOM_SEVERITY_ERROR; the default is 'False' if the
         value of the 'severity' property of 'error' is

      This event is triggered when a node owned by a
      document created by this TDomImplementation
      is about to be cleared. This event is
      dispatched before the node is cleared.

      Parameters:

            of object;

      This event is called when a user-defined function
      is found while an XPath expression is evaluated. 
      In this case an OnRequestXPathFunctionResult
      handler must return a TDomXPathCustomResult
      descendant which represents the return value of
      the user-defined function.
      
      Parameters:
      - NamespaceURI
         The namespace URI of the user-defined 
         function.
      - LocalName
         The local name of the user-defined function.
      - ContextNode
         The current context node for evaluating
         the user-defined function.  Note that this 
         is not necessarily the same as the context 
         node of the XPath expression evaluated 
         (cf. [XPath 1.0], sec. 1).
      - ContextPosition
         The current context position of the current
         context node.
      - ContextSize
         The current context size of the context of
         the current context node.
      - Arguments
         A TList object containing the arguments of
         the user-defined function represented as 
         TDomXPathExpr objects.  The event handler 
         must not change the contents of the TList 
         object!

      Var Parameters:
      - Value
         A TDomXPathCustomResult descendant which
         represents the return value of the 
         user-defined function.  When passing the 
         object it is no longer in scope of the 
         application.  In other words: ADOM 
         evaluates and then frees it.

      This event is called when a variable reference is
      found while an XPath expression is evaluated. In
      this case an OnRequestXPathVariable handler must
      return a TDomXPathCustomResult descendant which 
      represents the value for the specified variable 
      name.
      
      Note that information about the expression context
      is available via the contextNode and ownerDocument
      property of the TXPathExpression sender object.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The TXPathExpression object that requests
         the variable binding information.
      - NamespaceURI
         The namespace URI the variable reference is
         bound to.
      - LocalName
         The local name of the variable reference.

      Var Parameters:
      - Value
         A TDomXPathCustomResult descendant which
         represents the value the specified variable
         reference is bound to in the expression 
         context.  When passing the object it is no 
         longer in scope of the application.  In

(+) function HandleError(const Sender: TObject;
                         const Error: TDomError): Boolean;
    <literallayout>
      HandleError is a callback function used by the
      DomImplementation itself and by various parser
      classes when an error occures while processing
      XML data, or when doing some other processing
      (e.g. validating a document).

      If an OnError event is specified for this
      DomImplementation, then this OnError event is called
      and the value of its 'go' var-parameter is passed as
      the return value of this method.

      If no OnError event is specified,  then 'True' is
      returned if the value of the 'error.severity'
      property is DOM_SEVERITY_WARNING or DOM_SEVERITY_ERROR,
      and 'False' is returned if the value of the
      'error.severity' property is DOM_SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The object that called the function.  If this
         DomImplementation itself calls the function, it
         passes itself as the sender.
      - Error
         The error object that describes the error, this
         object may be reused by the Sender across
         multiple calls to the HandleError method.

      Return value:
         If the HandleError method returns true the
         DomImplementation (or a calling Parser) should
         continue as if the error didn't happen when
         possible, if the method returns false then the
         DomImplementation (or the Parser) should stop
         the current processing when possible.

      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if 'Error' is nil.

  <para>This class defines a sequential view of the source code of an XML document. It consists of a list of TXmlSourceCodePiece objects which represent distinct parts of an XML document such as e.g. text, start tags, end tags, empty element tags, or processing instructions. TXmlSourceCode objects might be created and used by an application in order to get easy access to a sequential rather than a tree view of an XML document. As TXMLSourceCode is derived from TList it holds the same properties, methods and functions. The following only describes where the TXmlSourceCode methods depart from the corresponding TList methods. For a full discribtion of the TList methods see the Delphi online manual.</para>

      WARNING: Do not use nil pointers to remove items
      from the list unless to free them, because their
      OwnerSourceCode property will not be updated and
      any attempt to add or insert them again will lead
      to an EListError exception. Also take into account,
      that modifying the pointer items directly will not
      automatically re-calculate the list item's offset
      property, which might lead to hardly predictable
      results when modifying the list again, due to the
      re-calculation behavior described above. However,
      if you want to remove a series of source code
      pieces from the list, it will be slow to remove
      them individually, because that will always call
      the offset re-calculation routine. Instead set
      the respective pointer items to 'nil', free the
      objects and call the pack procedure which will

<chapter>
<title>The Document Object Model</title>

<para>XML documents have a logical structure which is very much like a tree. In ADOM, documents are not only represent as a data structure, but modeled using objects which have functions and identity. With this objects programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using them.</para>

<para>ADOM supports three types of document object models:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>the non-namespace data model (based on TDomDocument),</listitem>
  <listitem>the namespace data model (based on TDomDocumentNS),</listitem>
  <listitem>the (namespace) XPath data model (based on TDomDocumentXPath).</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Because ADOM tries to follow W3C's DOM standard closely, it does syntactically allow the usage of namespace methods (indicated by the "NS" suffix) and non-namespace methods in either type of document tree. In fact, the namespace methods are meant only to be used for namespace-aware document trees (based on TDomDocumentNS and TDomDocumentXPath). Simple applications that do not use namespaces must use the non-namespace data model (based on TDomDocument) together with the non-namespace methods only. Elements and attributes created in this way do not have any namespace prefix, namespace URI, or local name.</para>

<para>Using namespace methods when dealing with non-namespace documents or using non-namespace methods when dealing with namespace documents must be avoided. Non-namespace methods solely identify attribute nodes by their NodeName. On the contrary, the namespace methods related to namespaces, identify attribute nodes by their NamespaceURI and LocalName. Because of this fundamental difference, mixing both sets of methods can lead to unpredictable results and may even raise exceptions. In particular, using TDomElement.SetAttributeNS, an element may have two attributes (or more) that have the same NodeName, but different NamespaceURIs. Calling TDomElement.GetAttribute with that node name could then return any of those attributes. The result may depend on the ADOM version. Similarly, using TDomElement.SetAttributeNode, one can set two attributes (or more) that have different NodeNames but the same Prefix and NamespaceURI. In this case TDomElement.GetAttributeNodeNS will return either attribute, in an ADOM version dependent manner.</para>

  <title>List Classes</title>
  
  <para>The following helper classes implement different kinds of node collections. The TDomNodeList class handles an ordered lists of nodes, such as the children of a node, or the elements returned by the TDomDocument.getElementsByTagName method. The TDomNamedNodeMape class handles unordered sets of nodes referenced by their Name property, such as the Attributes of an Element. TDomNodeLists and TDomNamedNodeMaps in the Document Object Model are <quote>live</quote>, that is, changes to the underlying document structure are reflected in all relevant TDomNodeLists and TDomNamedNodeMaps. For example, if a Standard Document Object Model user gets a TDomNodeList object containing the children of an element, then subsequently adds more children to that element (or removes children, or modifies them), those changes are automatically reflected in the TDomNodeList without further action on the user's part. Likewise changes to a node in the tree are reflected in all references to that node in TDomNodeLists and TDomNamedNodeMaps.</para>

(*) function SetNamedItem(const Arg: TDomNode): TDomNode; virtual;

      Adds a node using its nodeName property.  As the
      nodeName property is used to derive the name which
      the node must be stored under, multiple nodes of
      certain types (those that have a "special" string
      value) cannot be stored as the names would clash.
      This is seen as preferable to allowing nodes to be
      aliased.

      Parameters:
      - Arg
         A node to store in a named node map.  The node
         will later be accessible using the value of the
         'nodeName' property of the node.  If a node with
         that name is already present in the map, it is
         replaced by the new one.

      Return Value:
         If the new TDomNode replaces an existing node
         the replaced tdomNode is returned, otherwise nil

      Exceptions:

      Parameters:

  <title>TDomNode = class(TDomCustomNode) (*)</title>

  <para>The TDomNode class is the primary datatype for the entire Document Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree. While all objects descending from TDomNode expose methods for dealing with children, not all objects descending from TDomNode may have children. For example, TDomText nodes may not have children, and adding children to such nodes results in a EdomException being raised.</para>

  <para>The properties NodeName, NodeValue and Attributes are included as a mechanism to get at node information without casting down to the specific derived class. In cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a specific nodeType (such as NodeValue for an TDomElement or Attributes for a TDomComment), this returns and empty WideString or nil.</para>

  <para>The values of NodeName, NodeValue, and Attributes vary according to the node type as follows:</para>

(+) property AbsoluteIndex: Integer (readonly)
    <literallayout>
      Returns the index of a node in a document tree 
      relative to the document node which is the root 
      of the document tree.  The document node has an
      absoluteIndex of 0 and subsequent nodes are 
      numbered sequentially. If a node has any child 
      nodes, its AbsoluteIndex is one less than the 
      index of its first child node.
      
      Nodes which are not part of a complete
      document tree have an absoluteIndex of -1.
      
      Hint: Calculating the absolute index of a node
      is a performance critical operation, especially
      for high values, because the algorithm visits 
      every node between this node and the document 
      node.  Therefore, it is usually not a good idea
      to use the absoluteIndex property within a 
      loop, except if the DOM tree is small and
      performance is not an issue.

      The language of a or TDomXPathNamespace or
      TDomAttr node is determined is the same as the 
      language of its ownerElement node.  If the 
      TDomAttr or TDomXPathNamespace node does not 
      have an ownerElement node, this function 
      returns an empty WideString (even if the 
      attribute itself is a language declaration). 
      
      The language of an TDomElement node is 
      determined by the value of its xml:lang 
      attribute, or if it has no such attribute, by 
      the value of the xml:lang attribute of its 
      nearest ancestor that has such an attribute. 
      If none of its ancestors has an xml:lang 
      attribute, this function returns an empty 
      WideString.
      
      The language of all other node types is
      determined by the value of the xml:lang
      attribute of its nearest TDomElement node
      ancestor that has such an attribute. 
      If the node has no such ancestors, this

      associated with this Node. This is also the
      Document object used to create new nodes. When 
      this Node is a TDomCustomDocument object the 
      ownerDocument property is nil. The ownerDocument
      object of a TDomXPathNamespace node matches the
      ownerDocument object of its ownerElement node.

      Hint: The similar RootDocument property
      provides also access to the TDomCustomDocument object
      associated with this Node. In addition, if the
      node is of type TDomCustomDocument, it returns the
      TDomCustomDocument object itself.

      except TDomDocument, TDomDocumentNS, TDomDocumentXPath
      TDomDocumentFragment, and TDomAttr may have a 
      parent.  However, if a node has just been created 
      and not yet added to the tree, or if it has been 
      removed from the tree, this is nil.

    <listitem>
    <para>
    property Prefix: WideString
    <literallayout>
      The namespace prefix of this node or an empty
      WideString if it is unspecified.

      Note that setting this property, when permitted,
      changes the NodeName property, which holds the
      qualified name, as well as the TagName and
      Name properties of TDomElement and TDomAttr
      objects, when applicable.

      For TDomXPathNamespace nodes the Prefix
      property holds the prefix of the namespace 
      represented by the node. Trying to change the 
      prefix of a TDomXPathNamespace node has no 
      effect.

      For TDomElement and TDomAttr nodes created with non 
      namespace-aware constructors (TDomElement.Create or 
      TDomAttr.Create) and for nodes of any type this is 
      always an empty Widestring.  Note that trying to set 
      the prefix of such a node will raise an ENamespace_Err 
      exception.

      Exceptions on setting:
      - ENo_Modification_Allowed_Err
         Raised if this node is readonly.
      - EInvalid_Character_Err
         Raised if the specified prefix contains an
         illegal character.
      - ENamespace_Err
         Raised if the specified prefix is malformed, or if
         the NamespaceURI of this node is an empty 
         WideString, or if the specified prefix is 'xml' and
         the NamespaceURI is different from
         'http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace', [* or if the
         NamespaceURI is 'http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace'
         and the specified prefix is different from 'xml',] or 
         if this node is a TDomAttr and the specified prefix
         is 'xmlns' and the namespaceURI is different
         from 'http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/', or if this node
         is a TDomAttr and the QualifiedName of this node is

(*) function CloneNode(const Deep: Boolean): TDomNode; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Returns a duplicate of the node, i.e., serves
      as a generic copy constructor for Nodes. The
      duplicate node has no parent (parentNode
      returns nil)and no user data. User data 
      associated to the imported node is not carried 
      over. However, if any UserDataHandlers has been 
      specified along with the associated data these 
      handlers will be called with the appropriate 
      parameters before this method returns.

      Hint: To duplicate a node from another Document
      use the ImportNode function of the target
      document node.

      For all nodes, cloning a node creates a node
      object owned by the importing document, with
      property values identical to the source
      node's nodeName and nodeType, plus the
      properties related to namespaces (prefix and
      namespaces URI).  The source node is not
      altered.

      The following list describes the specifics
      for each type of node.

      ntAttribute_Node
      The ownerElement attribute is set to nil and
      the specified flag is set to true on the
      generated TDomAttr node. The descendants of
      the source TDomAttr node are recursively
      imported and the resulting nodes reassembled
      to form the corresponding subtree.  Note
      that the deep parameter has no effect on
      TDomAttr nodes; they always carry their
      children with them when cloned.

      ntDocument_Fragment_Node
      If the deep option was set to true, the
      descendants of the source element are
      recursively imported and the resulting
      nodes reassembled to form the corresponding
      subtree. Otherwise this simply generates
      an empty TDomDocumentFragment node.

      ntDocument_Node
      Document nodes cannot be cloned.

      ntDocument_Type_Decl_Node
      TDomDocumentTypeDecl nodes cannot be cloned.

      ntElement_Node
      Attribute nodes of the source element are
      cloned, and the generated TDomAttr nodes
      are attached to the generated TDomElement
      node.  If the cloneNode deep parameter
      was set to true, the descendants of the
      source element are recursively imported
      and the resulting nodes reassembled to
      form the corresponding subtree.

      ntEntity_Reference_Node
      Only the TDomEntityReference node itself is
      cloned, even if a deep import is requested.
      If the document the cloned node belongs to
      provides a definition for this entity name,
      its value is assigned.

      ntProcessing_Instruction_Node
      The duplicate node copies its target and data
      values from those of the source node.

      ntText_Node,
      ntCDATA_Section_Node,
      ntComment_Node
      These three types of nodes copy their data
      properties from those of the source node.  
      Text nodes also copy their charRefGenerated 
      property.

      ntXPath_Namespace_Node
      TDomXPathNamespace nodes cannot be cloned.

      Parameters:
      - Deep
         If true, recursively clone the subtree
         under the specified node; if false,
         import only the node itself (and its
         TDomAttr nodes, if it is a TDomElement
         node). This has no effect on TDomAttr
         and TDomEntityReference nodes.

      Return Value:
         The duplicate node.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the type of node being cloned is
         not supported.

           followed by an optional minus sign followed by
           an XPath Number followed by whitespace is 
           converted to the IEEE 754 number that is 
           nearest (according to the IEEE 754 
           round-to-nearest rule) to the mathematical 
           value represented by the string; any other 
           string is converted to NaN.
         - Boolean true is converted to 1; Boolean false 
           is converted to 0.
         - A node-set is first converted to a string as 
           if by a call to the XPath string() function

         - The Boolean False value is converted to the
           WideString 'False'. The Boolean True value 
           is converted to the string 'True'.
         - A number is converted to a WideString as 
           follows:
           - NaN is converted to the WideString 'NaN'.
           - Positive zero is converted to the

             preceded by a minus sign (-) if the number
             is negative.
           - Otherwise the number is represented in 
             decimal form as a Number including a 
             decimal point with at least one digit
             before the decimal point and at least one
             digit after the decimal point, preceded by
             a minus sign (-) if the number is negative;
             there must be no leading zeros before the 
             decimal point apart possibly from the one
             required digit immediately before the
             decimal point; beyond the one required 
             digit after the decimal point there must 
             be as many, but only as many, more digits
             as are needed to uniquely distinguish the

      i.e., there are no adjacent TDomText nodes.
      This can be used to ensure that the DOM view
      of a document is the same as if it were
      saved and re-loaded, and is useful when

      structure are to be used. Note: In cases
      where the document contains TDomCDATASection
      nodes, the normalize operation alone may not
      be sufficient, since XPointers do not
      differentiate between TDomText nodes and

    <literallayout>
      Create a new TDomNodeIterator over the subtree
      rooted at the specified node.

      Parameters:
      - Root
         The node which will be iterated together
         with its children. The iterator is
         initially positioned just before this
         node. The whatToShow flags and the filter,
         if any, are not considered when setting
         this position.
      - WhatToShow
         This flag specifies which node types may
         appear in the logical view of the tree
         presented by the iterator.
      - NodeFilter
         The Filter to be used with this
         TDomNodeIterator, or nil to indicate no
         filter.
      - EntityReferenceExpansion
         The value of this flag determines whether
         entity reference nodes are expanded.

      Return Value:
         The newly created TDomNodeIterator.

    <literallayout>
      Create a new TDomTreeWalker over the subtree
      rooted at the specified node.

      Parameters:
      - Root
         The node which will serve as the root for
         the TDomTreeWalker. The whatToShow flags
         and the TDomNodeFilter are not considered
         when setting this value; any node type
         will be accepted as the root. The
         currentNode of the TDomTreeWalker is
         initialized to this node, whether or not
         it is visible. The root functions as a
         stopping point for traversal methods
         that look upward in the document
         structure, such as parentNode and
         nextNode. The root must not be nil.

         This flag specifies which node types may

(#) function GetElementById(const ElementId: WideString): TDomElement;

      Returns the TDomElement whose ID is given by
      elementId. If no such element exists nil is
      returned. The behavior is not defined if more
      than one element has this ID.

      IMPORTANT:  Which attributes are of type ID
      is determined by evaluating the abstract
      schema models associated with the document
      when validating the document.  Therefore it
      is necessary to successfully call the
      TDomDocument.ValidationAgent.ValidateDocument 
      function before the GetElementById function 
      can be used.

      Hint: Attributes with the name "ID" are not
      of type ID unless so defined.

      Parameters:
      - ElementId
         The unique id value for an element.

      Return Value:
         The matching element.

    function GetElementsByTagName(const TagName: WideString): TDomNodeList;
    virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Returns a TDomNodeList of all the TDomElement
      nodes with a given tag name in the order in
      which they would be encountered in a preorder
      traversal of the document tree.

      Hint: Calling this function will internally
      create a TDomNodeList for the specified tag
      name unless this had been done by a previous
      call. This TDomNodeList will be freed either
      when the clear method of the document is
      called or when the document itself is freed.
      Therefore calling the GetElementsByTagName
      function very often with different tag names
      will result in high memory usage; and since
      the DOM requires TDomNodeLists to be &quot;live&quot;,
      calling the TDomElementsNodeList.item method
      always starts a re-calculation of the index by
      traversing the node tree from the beginning
      till the specified element is found.

      So using this method to traverse the elements
      of large documents is considerably slower than
      using a node iterator or a tree walker with an
      appropriate filter and might need more of the
      computer's memory. It is therefore highly
      recommended to use a node iterator or a tree
      walker with an appropriate filter instead.

      Parameters:
      - TagName
         The name of the tag to match on. If the
         string "*" is given, this method returns
         all elements in the document.

      Return Value:
         A new TDomNodeList object containing all
         the TDomElements.

(#) function ImportNode(const ImportedNode;
                        const Deep: Boolean): TDomNode; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Imports a node from another document to this
      document. The returned node has no parent
      (parentNode returns nil). The source node
      is not altered or removed from the original
      document; this method creates a new copy of
      the source node.

      For all nodes, importing a node creates a
      node object owned by the importing document,
      with property values identical to the source
      node's nodeName and nodeType.  As in the cloneNode
      operation on a Node, the source node is not
      altered.  User data associated to the imported
      node is not carried over. However, if any 
      user data handler has been specified along 
      with the associated data these handlers will
      be called with the appropriate parameters 
      before this method returns.

      Additional information is copied as
      appropriate to the nodeType, attempting to
      mirror the behavior expected if a fragment of
      XML source was copied from one document to
      another, recognizing that the two documents
      may have different DTDs.

      The following list describes the specifics
      for each type of node.

      ntAttribute_Node
      The ownerElement attribute is set to nil
      and the specified flag is set to true on the
      generated TDomAttr node.

      ntDocument_Fragment_Node
      If the deep option was set to true, the
      descendants of the source element are
      recursively imported and the resulting
      nodes reassembled to form the corresponding
      subtree. Otherwise this simply generates
      an empty TDomDocumentFragment node.

      ntDocument_Node
      document nodes cannot be imported.

      ntDocument_Type_Decl_Node
      TDomDocumentTypeDecl nodes cannot be imported.

      ntElement_Node
      Specified attribute nodes of the source
      element are imported, and the generated
      TDomAttr nodes are attached to the
      generated TDomElement node. Default
      attributes are not copied, so if this
      document defines default attributes for 
      the element type, an application must 
      explicitly generate them by calling the 
      PrepareAttributes function.

      ntEntity_Reference_Node
      Only the TDomEntityReference node itself is
      copied, even if a deep import is requested,
      since the source and destination documents
      might have defined the entity differently.
      If the document being imported into provides
      a definition for this entity name, its value
      is assigned.

      ntProcessing_Instruction_Node
      The imported node copies its target and data
      values from those of the source node.

      ntText_Node,
      ntCDATA_Section_Node,
      ntComment_Node
      These three types of nodes copy their data
      properties from those of the source node.  
      Text nodes also copy their charRefGenerated 
      property.

      ntXPath_Namespace_Node
      TDomXPathNamespace nodes cannot be imported.

      Parameters:
      - ImportedNode
         The node to import.
      - Deep
         If True, recursively import the subtree
         under the specified node; if False,
         import only the node itself (and its
         TDomAttr nodes, if it is a TDomElement
         node). This has no effect on TDomAttr
         and TDomEntityReference nodes.

      Return Value:
         The imported node that belongs to this
         TDomDocument object.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the type of node being imported
         is not supported or if the value of the
         'importedNode' parameter is nil.

      False are first removed and freed.  New TDomAttr 
      nodes for all now missing fixed and default 
      attributes are added (with their Specified 
      property set to False).  If the default value of 
      an attribute to be inserted is malformed this 
      attribute is skipped and the function returns
      False.

      Hint: Specified attributes in the document are not
      tested for validity.  If an application wants to
      prepare attributes and check the validity of
      the whole document at the same time, it may call
      TDomDocument.ValidationAgent.ValidateDocument. 

      Return Value:
         True, if all relevant attribute declaration 
         could be processed.  False, if an attribute
         was skipped due to a malformed declaration.

      The Sorted property of this TUtilsWideStringList is

      The application is responsible to initialize or update

      Create a new TDomNodeIterator over the subtree
      rooted at the specified node.

      Parameters:
      - Root
         The node which will be iterated together
         with its children. The iterator is
         initially positioned just before this
         node. The WhatToShow flags and the filter,
         if any, are not considered when setting
         this position.
      - WhatToShow
         This flag specifies which node types may
         appear in the logical view of the tree
         presented by the iterator.
      - NodeFilter
         The filter to be used with this
         TDomNodeIterator, or nil to indicate no
         filter.
      - EntityReferenceExpansion
         The value of this flag determines whether

      Create a new TDomTreeWalker over the subtree

      Parameters:
      - Root
         The node which will serve as the root for
         the TDomTreeWalker. The WhatToShow flags
         and the TDomNodeFilter are not considered
         when setting this value; any node type

         currentNode of the TDomTreeWalker is
         initialized to this node, whether or not
         it is visible. The root functions as a
         stopping point for traversal methods
         that look upward in the document structure, 
         such as ParentNode and NextNode. The Root
         must not be nil.

         This flag specifies which node types may
         appear in the logical view of the tree

         The filter to be used with this

      IMPORTANT:  Which attributes are of type ID is

      application initializes the IDs list with the
      correct values before the GetElementById 
      function can be used.

                                          virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Returns a TDomNodeList of all the TDomElements
      with a given local name and namespace URI in
      the order in which they would be encountered
      in a preorder traversal of the Document tree.

      Hint: Calling this function will internally
      create a TDomNodeList for the specified
      namespace URI and local name unless this had
      been done by a previous call.  This TDomNodeList
      will be freed either when the Clear method of
      the document is called or when the document
      itself is freed.  Therefore calling the
      GetElementsByTagNameNS function very often with
      different parameters will result in high memory
      usage; and since the DOM requires TDomNodeLists
      to be &quot;live&quot;, calling the TDomElementsNodeList.item
      method always starts a re-calculation of the
      index by traversing the node tree from the
      beginning till the specified element is found.

      So using this method to traverse the elements
      of large documents is considerably slower than
      using a node iterator or a tree walker with an
      appropriate filter and might need more of the
      computer's memory. It is therefore highly
      recommended to use a node iterator or a tree
      walker with an appropriate filter instead.

      Parameters:
      - NamespaceURI
         The namespace URI of the elements to
         match on. The special value '*' matches
         all namespaces.
      - LocalName
         The local name of the elements to match
         on. The special value '*' matches all
         local names.

      Return Value:
         A new TDomNodelist object containing all
         the matched TDomElements.

(#) function ImportNode(const ImportedNode;
                        const Deep: Boolean): TDomNode; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Imports a node from another document to this
      document. The returned node has no parent
      (ParentNode returns nil). The source node
      is not altered or removed from the original
      document; this method creates a new copy of
      the source node.

      For all nodes, importing a node creates a
      node object owned by the importing document,
      with property values identical to the source
      node's NodeName and NodeType, plus the
      properties related to namespaces (Prefix and
      Namespaces URI).  As in the CloneNode
      operation on a Node, the source node is not
      altered.  User data associated to the imported
      node is not carried over. However, if any 
      user data handler has been specified along 
      with the associated data these handlers will
      be called with the appropriate parameters 
      before this method returns.

      Additional information is copied as
      appropriate to the NodeType, attempting to
      mirror the behavior expected if a fragment of
      XML source was copied from one document to
      another, recognizing that the two documents
      may have different DTDs.

      The following list describes the specifics
      for each type of node.

      ntAttribute_Node
      The OwnerElement attribute is set to nil
      and the specified flag is set to true on the
      generated TDomAttr node.

      ntDocument_Fragment_Node
      If the Deep option was set to true, the
      descendants of the source element are
      recursively imported and the resulting
      nodes reassembled to form the corresponding
      subtree. Otherwise this simply generates
      an empty TDomDocumentFragment node.

      ntDocument_Node
      Document nodes cannot be imported.

      ntDocument_Type_Decl_Node
      TDomDocumentTypeDecl nodes cannot be imported.

      ntElement_Node
      Specified attribute nodes of the source
      element are imported, and the generated
      TDomAttr nodes are attached to the
      generated TDomElement node. Default
      attributes are not copied, so if this
      document defines default attributes for 
      the element type, an application must 
      explicitly generate them by calling the 
      PrepareAttributes function.

      ntEntity_Reference_Node
      Only the TDomEntityReference node itself is
      copied, even if a deep import is requested,
      since the source and destination documents
      might have defined the entity differently.
      If the document being imported into provides
      a definition for this entity name, its value
      is assigned.

      ntProcessing_Instruction_Node
      The imported node copies its target and data
      values from those of the source node.

      ntText_Node,
      ntCDATA_Section_Node,
      ntComment_Node
      These three types of nodes inheriting from
      TDomCharacterData copy their Data and Length
      attributes from those of the source node.

      ntXPath_Namespace_Node
      TDomXPathNamespace nodes cannot be imported.

      Parameters:
      - importedNode
         The node to import.
      - deep
         If True, recursively import the subtree
         under the specified node; if False,
         import only the node itself (and its
         TDomAttr nodes, if it is a TDomElement
         node). This has no effect on TDomAttr
         and TDomEntityReference nodes.

      Return Value:
         The imported node that belongs to this
         TDomDocument object.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the type of node being imported
         is not supported or if the value of the
         ImportedNode parameter is nil.

  <title>TDomDocumentFragment = class(TDomNode)</title>

  <para> TDomDocumentFragment is a lightweight or minimal Document object. It is very common to want to be able to extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a document. Imagine implementing a user command like cut or rearranging a document by moving fragments around. It is desirable to have an object which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural to use a Node for this purpose. While it is true that a Document object could fulfil this role, a Document object can potentially be a heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is really needed for this is a very lightweight object. TDomDocumentFragment is such an object.</para>

  <para>Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children of another Node -- may take TDomDocumentFragment objects as arguments; this results in all the child nodes of the TDomDocumentFragment being moved to the child list of this node.</para>

  <para>The children of a TDomDocumentFragment node are zero or more nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the document. TDomDocumentFragment do not need to be well-formed XML documents (although they do need to follow the rules imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top nodes). For example, a TDomDocumentFragment might have only one child and that child node could be a Text node. Such a structure model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML document.</para>

  <para>When a TDomDocumentFragment is inserted into a document object (or indeed any other node that may take children) the children of the TDomDocumentFragment and not the TDomDocumentFragment itself are inserted into the Node. This makes the TDomDocumentFragment very useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the TDomDocumentFragment acts as the parent of these nodes so that the user can use the standard methods from the TDomNode class, such as InsertBefore and AppendChild.</para>

Thus, the TDomNode properties ParentNode, PreviousSibling, and NextSibling have a nil value for TDomAttr objects. ADOM takes the view that attributes are properties of elements rather than having a separate identity from the elements they are associated with. Furthermore, TDomAttribute nodes may not be immediate children of a TDomDocumentFragment object. However, they can be associated with TDomElement nodes contained within a TDomDocumentFragment object. In short, users need to be aware that TDomAttribute nodes have some things in common with other objects inheriting the TDomNode class, but they also are quite distinct.</para>

  <para>The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this attribute has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for this attribute, and that declaration includes a default value, then that default value is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, the attribute does not exist on this element in the structure model until it has been explicitly added.  Note that the NodeValue property inherited from TDomNode can be used to set or retrieve the attribute's literal value.</para>

      If this attribute was explicitly given a value in the
      original document, this is True; otherwise, it is False.
      Note that the implementation is in charge of this
      attribute, not the user. If the user changes the value
      of the attribute (even if it ends up having the same
      value as the default value) then the specified flag is
      automatically flipped to True. To re-specify the
      attribute as the default value from the DTD, the user
      must delete the attribute, and then the implementation
      will make a new attribute available with specified set
      to False and the default value (if one exists).

      In summary: If the attribute has an assigned value in
      the document and specified is True, the value is the
      assigned value. If the attribute has no assigned value
      in the document and has a default value in the DTD, then
      specified is False, and the value is the default value
      in the DTD. If the attribute has no assigned value in
      the document and has a value of #IMPLIED in the DTD,
      then the attribute does not appear in the structure
      model of the document.

      Returns the normalized value of the attribute as 
      described in [XML 1.0], sec. 3.3.3.

      Note that if the attribute is attached to an TDomElement
      and if information about the attribute type is available
      via a TDtdAttributeDecl object in a document structure
      model associated with the owner document of the attribute
      and if the so determined attribute type is not CDATA,

      by discarding any leading and trailing space (#$20)
      characters, and by replacing sequences of space (#$20)
      characters by a single space (#$20) character.

      Hint: Use the NodeValue property to set or retrieve the
      attribute's literal value.  &amp;, &lt; and " characters must,
      &gt; and ' characters should be escaped by references to
      their corresponding predefined entities.  There exists a

  <title>TDomElement = class(TDomNode) (*)</title>

  <para>A TDomElement objects represents an element an XML document. Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the TDomElement class inherits from TDomNode, the generic TDomNode.Attributes property may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an element. There are methods on the TDomElement class to retrieve either an TDomAttr object by name or directly an attribute value by name. Since an attribute value may contain entity references, a TDomAttr object should be retrieved to examine the possibly fairly complex sub-tree representing the attribute value.</para>

  <para>Hint: Note that a TDomElement.NodeValue property is always an empty WideString.  Attempting to assign another value has no effect. The information about the content of an element (such as text, other elements, comments, etc. between a start tag and its corresponding end tag) is accessible through the element's set of child nodes.</para>

      Returns a TDomNodeList of all descendant
      TDomElements with a given tag name in the
      order in which they would be encountered
      in a preorder traversal of the Element
      tree. Note that calling this function

      TDomNodeList will (only) be freed when
      the TDomElement itself is freed. Since
      calling the GetElementsByTagName function
      very often with different tag names will
      result in high memory usage, it is
      recommended to use a node iterator or a
      tree walker with an appropriate filter
      instead. Since the DOM requires
      TDomNodeLists to be &quot;live&quot;,
      calling the TDomElementsNodeList.item
      method always starts a re-calculation of
      the index by traversing the node tree

  <title>TDomText = class(TDomCharacterData)</title>

  <para>The TDomText object represents the textual content (termed "character data" in XML) of an Element or Attribute. If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is contained in a single TDomText object that is the child of the element. Any markup is parsed into child elements that are siblings of the text nodes on either side of it, and whose content is represented as text node children of the markup element.</para>

  <para>When a document object model is first made available using one of the parsing methods of a TXmlToDomParser component, there is only one TDomText node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent Text nodes that represent the contents of a given element without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way to represent the separations between these nodes in XML, so they will not (in general) persist between XML editing sessions. The normalize method on TDomElement merges any such adjacent TDomText objects into a single node for each block of text; this is recommended before employing operations that depend on a particular document structure, such as navigation with XPointers.</para>

    <literallayout>
      Returns True if this text node contains only
      whitespace in element content, often abusively
      called 'ignorable whitespace'; otherwise or if
      the document structure model (DTD or Schema, etc.)
      of the owner document of this Text node does not
      contain an element declaration for this text node's
      parent element or if this text node has no parent
      element or if there exists no document structure
      model for the owner document of this text node, 
      False is returned.

      Note that whitespace characters generated directly 
      from character references do not qualify for 
      whitespace in element content (see [XML 1.0], 
      sect. 3, prod. [39] "VC: Element Valid").
      
      Hint: To automatically build an document structure

      siblings. This node then only contains all the
      content up to the offset point. And a new text
      node, which is inserted as the next sibling of
      this node, contains all the content at and
      after the offset point.

      Note that the CharRefGenerated property of the
      new Text node has the same value as that of the
      old Text node.

      Parameters:
      - Offset
         The offset at which to split, starting from 0.

      Return Value:
         This method returns the new text node

  <title>TDomCDATASection = class(TDomText)</title>

  <para>CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is recognized in a CDATA section is the <quote>]]&gt;</quote> string that ends the CDATA section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. The primary purpose is for including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all the delimiters. Applications should be aware of the fact that CDATA sections are nevertheless bound to the character range defined in [XML 1.0], sect. 2.2, prod. [2]: #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF]| [#xE000-#xFFFD]| [#x10000-#x10FFFF] mapped to UTF-16.  Therefore CDATA sections may not be used directly with a character encoding (&quot;charset&quot;) or binary data which use values excluded by prod. [2] mapped to UTF-16. Instead an application should use a conversion function for illegal values and convert the data back on retrieval, or use an external unparsed entity to refer to the data.</para>

  <title>TDomEntityReference = class(TDomNode) (*)</title>

  <para> TDomEntityReference objects may be inserted into the structure model when an entity reference is in the source document, or when the user wishes to insert an entity reference. Note that character entities are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent rather than by an entity reference. The replacement value of the referenced entity, if available, appears in the child list of the TDomEntityReference object. Alternatively, the XML processor may completely expand references to entities while building the structure model, instead of providing EntityReference objects.</para>

  <para>XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and process entity declarations made in the external subset or declared in external parameter entities. This means that parsed entities declared in the external subset need not be expanded by some classes of applications, and that the replacement value of the entity may not be available.</para>

  <para>The resolution of the children of the EntityReference (the replacement value of the referenced entity) may be lazily evaluated; actions by the user (such as calling the childNodes method on the EntityReference Node) are assumed to trigger the evaluation.</para>

      because each TDomDocument objects maintains 
      its own validation agent.

      Parameters:
      - AOwner
         The TDomDocument node which owns this
         TDtdValidationAgent instance.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err

    procedure BuildDtdModel(const ResolveExtEntities: Boolean); virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Builds or rebuilds the associated DTD object model
      for the owner document, based on the owner
      document's DoctypeDecl node, if any.

      How external parameter entities are treated when
      building the DTD object model is governed by the 
      ResolveExtEntities property.

      Parsing errors are reported to the application via
      the OnError event of the owner document's
      associated TDomImplementation component.  The
      location information offset is determined by
      the IntSubsetStartByteNumber, IntSubsetStartCharNumber,
      IntSubsetStartColumn, and IntSubsetStartLine
      properties of the owner document's DoctypeDecl node.

      Applications may use the OnResolveResource event 
      of the associated TDomImplementation component to 
      redirect reference resolution to external resources.
      
      After calling BuildDtdModel, the PreparationStatus 
      property of the associated DTD object model holds 
      information about whether and to what extent the DTD 
      model had been successfully built.

      Hint: If the function does not accept your stream and 
      reports an invalid character, this is in most cases 
      caused by a missing or false text declaration at the 
      beginning of an external entity.  Note that you may 
      only skip a text declaration if the external entity is
      encoded in the default UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding.  For 
      all other encodings, e.g. those from the ISO-8859-x 
      family, a text declaration is required, for example:
         &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
      when you use the Latin1 character set.

      Parameters:
      - ResolveExtEntities
         Indicates how external parameter entities and the
         external subset of the DTD should be treated when
         building a DTD object model.  
      
         A value of True indicates that an external subset
         should be processed as well as all references to 
         external parameter entities should be resolved and 
         their replacement text be parsed (even if they 
         appear in the internal subset).  This behaviour is
         equivalent to what a validating processor is
         supposed to do.
      
         A value of False indicates that an external subset 
         should not be processed and all references to 
         external parameter entities in the internal subset 
         should either (i) be skipped but subsequent 
         declarations be processed as usual or (ii) be 
         ignored and subsequent declarations not be 
         processed but still be checked for wellformedness 
         (which of the alternatives (i) or (ii) takes place
         depents on the value of the standalone status of 
         the document to which the document type declaration
         belongs).  This behaviour is equivalent to what a 
         non-validating processor is supposed to do.

    <listitem>
    <para>
    function ValidateDocument(const Opt: TDomEntityResolveOption): Boolean; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Validates the owner document according to the DTD
      contained in a TDomDocumentTypeDecl child node.

      Each fatal error, error or warning encountered is
      reported via the OnError event of the corresponding
      DomImplementation component.  This might occur more
      than once, if more than one fatal error, error or
      warning is encountered.  Location information in
      error reports depends on the associated 
      TDomDocumentTypeDecl node's IntSubsetStartByteNumber, 
      IntSubsetStartCharNumber, IntSubsetStartColumn, and 
      IntSubsetStartLine properties.

      When validating an internal list of ID attributes 
      is updated which is used by the document's 
      GetElementById function.  However, this fails, if 
      the document is not valid; in that case, the IDs 
      list is empty.

      Validating a document also resolves its entity
      references.  The Opt parameter controls whether the
      entity references found are replaced or expanded (see
      below).  If the owner document is invalid, validating 
      it may lead to a document tree with incompletely 
      resolved entities.

      Parameters:
      - Opt
         If Opt is erReplace, then all TDomEntityReference
         found in the document are recursively being replaced
         by nodes or node trees according to its entity's
         declaration. Attribute values are normalized and 
         modified as follows:  All ampersands (&amp;) are 
         replaced with &amp;amp;, all open angle brackets (&lt;) with 
         &amp;lt;, all quotation mark characters with &amp;quot;, and 
         the whitespace characters #x9, #xA, and #xD, with 
         character references. The character references are 
         written in uppercase hexadecimal with no leading zeroes 
         (for example, #xD is represented by the character 
         reference &amp;#xD;).

         If Opt is erExpand, then to each TDomEntityReference
         node found in the document a subtree of nodes is added
         according to its entity's declaration.  The subtree
         itself will not contain any TDomEntityReference.
         Instead every entity reference _inside_ this subtree
         is recursively replaced (not expanded) by nodes or
         node trees according to its entity's declaration.

         Note that a TDomEntityReference cannot be resolved,
         if there exists no corresponding entity declaration for
         this entity reference or for an entity reference in its 
         subtree, or if its corresponding enity is an unparsed 
         entity, or if the literal value of the corresponding 
         enity leads to a violation of one of the XML 
         wellformedness or validity constraint in the context 
         of its owner object, e.g. if it contains a (probably 
         indirect) reference to itself.

      Return Value:
         True if the document is valid, False otherwise.

    <literallayout>
      Creates and adds a TDtdEntityDecl object to
      the list of entity declarations unless an
      declaration for the same entity name is already
      there.

      Parameters:
      - Name
         The name of the represented entity declaration to
         create and add.
      - ReplacementText
         The replacement text of the TDtdEntityDecl
         to create and add if the entity is an internal
         parsed entity.  

         Note that in case of an internal entity "the 
         replacement text is the content of the entity 
         after replacement of character references and 
         parameter-entity references" ([XML 1.0], sec. 
         4.5.)

         The 'replacementText' parameter is being
         ignored if 'publicId', 'systemId' or
         'notationName' is not an empty WideString,
         thus indicating an external entity (parsed or
         unparsed).  

         Hint: To initialize the replacement text of 
         an external parsed entity call the Resolve
         method of the new TDtdEntityDecl object.

      - publicId
         The public ID of the TDtdEntityDecl to
         create and add, or an empty WideString if
         the entity is internal.
      - SystemId
         The system ID of the TDtdEntityDecl to
         create and add, or an empty WideString if
         the entity is internal.
      - NotationName
         The notation name of the TDtdEntityDecl to
         create and add, or an empty WideString if
         the entity is a parsed entity.
      - BaseUri
         The base URI of the entity declaration, i.e.
         the URI of the entity containing the '&lt;' 
         which starts the declaration, at the point 
         when it is parsed as a declaration.
      - Origin
         DTD_EXTERNALLY_DECLARED, if the declaration 
         appears in the external subset of a DTD or in
         a parameter entity (external or internal, the 
         latter being included because non-validating 
         processors are not required to read them). 
         DTD_INTERNALLY_DECLARED otherwise.
         The value DTD_PREDEFINED is not supported and
         raises a ENot_Supported_Err exception.

      Out Parameters:
      - EntityDecl
         The newly created TDtdEntityDecl object or
         the old TDtdEntityDecl object if a
         declaration of the specified name is already
         there.

      Return Value:
         'True' if a new TDtdEntityDecl object was
         created and added to the list of entity
         declarations, 'False' if no new TDtdEntityDecl
         was added, because a declaration of the same
         name is already there.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if Origin is DTD_PREDEFINED.

<title>Document Object Model Views</title>

<para>A document may have one or more "views" associated with it, e.g., a computed view on a document after applying a CSS stylesheet, or multiple presentations (e.g., HTML Frame) of the same document in a client. That is, a view is some alternate representation of, or a presentation of, and associated with, a source document. A view may be static, reflecting the state of the document when the view was created, or dynamic, reflecting changes in the target document as they occur, subsequent to the view being created.</para>

<para>ADOM defines a TDomAbstractView class which provides a base class from which all such views shall derive. It defines an attribute which references the target document of the TDomAbstractView. The only semantics of the TDomAbstractView defined here create an association between a view and its target document.</para>

<title>Parsing and Serializing XML (+)</title>

<sect1>
<title>Introduction</title>

<sect2>
<title>Design goals</title>

<para>Writing an XML parser is always a compromise between competing requirements which can be divided into three basic groups: user goals, developer goals and implementer goals.</para>

<para>Users of an application which needs to parse XML data expect the parser to be reliable, fast, and efficient. For developers, who want to integrate the parser in their applications, it is important that the design is flexible enough to adapt to a wide variety of use cases. And for the implementer of a parser it should be easy to maintain the source code, while the reusability of code pieces should be maximized.</para>

<para>In order to achive a large degree of maintainability, reusability, and flexibility the design of ADOM's parser classes is highly object oriented.  Though ADOM provides the user with some simple, ready-to-use parser components like TXmlToDomParser, TDtdToDtdModelParser, and TDomToXmlParser, these components are internally built out of several fundamental XML processor components. All communication between the fundamental components is performed by passing single XML Signal objects, each representing a small pieces of XML data.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Conformance</title>

<para>ADOM's XML parser components may be used to build a fully conforming validating XML processor according to the [XML 1.0] specification.  This validating XML processor was check against the XML test suite published by the W3C and passed all XML 1.0 related tests.</para>

<para>To use ADOM as a validating XML processor an application must use a TXmlToDomParser component which is connected to a TDomImplementation component itself connected to a Resource Resolver (if required).  The KeepCDATASections and KeepComments options of the TXmlToDomParser component must both be set to True.  In a first step the XML document to be validated must be parsed into a document object tree by using any of the TXmlToDomParser component's parsing methods.  Afterward the ValidationAgent.ValidateDocument function of the returned TDomDocument object must be called.</para>

<para>Currently ADOM does not include a conforming non-validating XML processor.  Calling the TXmlToDomParser parsing functions is not equivalent to using a non-validating XML processor, because these functions do not process the DTD of a document and check it for wellformedness.</para>

<para>Note that the XML specification allows slight differences between validating XML processors.  Validating XML processors must report violations of the wellformedness and validation constraints, but they are not required to report errors which are not rated as wellformedness or validation constraints.  The results of violating such rules are undefined.  In such cases the result of validating an XML document with ADOM may differ from the result of other validators.  In particular, ADOM does not check the value of an 'xml:space' attribute, it does not test whether system literals are not URI fragments, accepts non-deterministic content models as long as their non-determinsm does not effect the validation of a particular document, and accepts a reference to an unparsed entity in an entity value (unless the entity is referenced, of course).</para>

    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    <literallayout>
      Creates a new TXmlToDomParser object. Note that
      TXmlToDomParser objects are being created automatically
      when adding them from the component's palette onto a
      form.

      If you derive your own parser class from TXmlToDomParser
      which contain replacements for the original Handlers, 
      Builders and Readers, you must override the protected
      CreateSubcomponents procedure which is called by this
      constructor.

      Parameters:
      - AOwner
         The component that holds the new TXmlToDomParser
         object.

    <para>
    function Parse(const InputSource: TXmlInputSource): TDomDocument; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Reads an XML document from a TXmlInputSource object
      and parses it into a Document Object Model tree.

      Parameters:
      - InputSource
         The TXmlInputSource object to be parsed.

      Return Value:
         A newly created TDomDocument node containing the 
         resulting document tree of the parsing process.  
         The DocumentUri property of this document node is 
         set to the value of the SystemId property of the
         specified input source.  The document node is 
         attached to the TDomImplementation object 
         specified by the DOMImpl property at the time the 
         function is called -- which means that this
         document node is automatically freed, when the 
         TDomImplementation object is being destroyed. 
         However the document can be freed explicitly by 
         calling its Free method.

      Exceptions:
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if there is no TDomImplementation component 
         associated with this TXmlToDomParser component, or
         if no TXmlInputSource object is specified.
      - EParserException
         Raised if the parser stumbles over a non-wellformed
         entity in the XML document.  Note that not every
         violation of a wellformedness constraint as defined
         in [XML 1.0] can be detected by parsing a document.
         Some of them can only be discovered by validating
         the document.

    function ParseFile(const Filename: TFileName;
                       const InclDecl: Boolean): TDomDocument; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Reads an XML document from a data medium and parses
      it into a Document Object Model tree.

      The parsed document is not automatically validated
      nor is its DTD checked for wellformedness.  Entity
      references to the predefined entities "lt", "gt",
      "amp", "apos", and "quote" are only being resolved
      if the KeepEntityRefs property is set to False.  
      Therefore, if KeepEntityRefs has the value True and
      the XML document to be parsed contains for example
      the line
          &lt;foo> &amp;amp; &lt;/foo>
      this will result in a TDomElement node with three
      child nodes: 1. a TDomText node whose NodeValue is
      a space character, 2. a TDomEntityReference node
      whose NodeName is 'amp', 3. again a TDomText node
      whose NodeValue is a space character.

      To validate the document and expand or replace its
      entity references call the ValidateDocument function
      of its associated ValidationAgent.

      HINT:  If the parser does not accept your document and
      reports an invalid character, this is in most cases caused
      by a missing or false XML declaration at the beginning of
      the document.  Note that you may only skip an XML
      declaration if the XML document is encoded in the default
      UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding.  For all other encodings, e.g.
      those from the ISO-8859-x family, an XML declaration is
      required, for example:
         &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
      when you use the Latin1 character set.

      Parameters:
      - Filename
         The filename of the document to be parsed.
      - InclDecl
         If True, location information includes any XML
         declaration at the beginning of the XML document. 
         If False, the location information is calculated 
         as if no XML declaration had been found.

      Return Value:
         A newly created TDomDocument node containing the 
         resulting document tree of the parsing process.  The 
         DocumentUri property of this document node is set to 
         the specified Filename value (transformed into an 
         URI, of course).  The document node is attached to 
         the TDomImplementation object specified by the 
         DOMImpl property at the time the function is called 
         -- which means that this document node is
         automatically freed, when the TDomImplementation 
         object is being destroyed. However the document can 
         be freed explicitly by calling its Free method. Here 
         is a code example:

    <literallayout>
      Reads an XML document from an external resource and
      parses it into a Document Object Model tree.
      
      The parser attempts to retrieve the document to parse
      via the resource resolver specified in its associated 
      DOM Implementation component (see the DOMImpl 
      property).  The resource resolver must, of course, be
      able to handle the requested URI scheme (such as 
      'http', 'file' or 'ftp') or to map the specified 
      public identifier to an input stream.

      Parameters:
      - BaseUri
         The base URI to be used (see section 5.1.4 in 
         [RFC 2396]) for resolving a relative SystemId to 
         an absolute URI.
      - PublicId
         The public identifier of the XML document to be
         parsed, or an empty WideString, if the public
         identifier is unknown.
      - SystemId
         The system identifier, a URI reference (see 
         [RFC 2396]), of the XML document to be parsed, 
         or an empty WideString, if the system identifier 
         is unknown.
      - Encoding
         The encoding of the external resource if known, or
         nil if unkown. If nil, the effective codec class is 
         determined with the help of the input stream's 
         byte order mark or the encoding value of an XML or 
         text declaration or set to the default 'UTF-8' 
         encoding, if none of the former applied.
      - InclDecl
         If True, location information includes any XML
         declaration at the beginning of the XML document. 
         If False, the location information is calculated 
         as if no XML declaration had been found.

      Return Value:
         A newly created TDomDocument node containing the 
         resulting document tree of the parsing process.  
         The DocumentUri property of this document node is 
         set to the specified Uri value.  The document 
         node is attached to the TDomImplementation object 
         specified by the DOMImpl property at the time the 
         function is called -- which means that this
         document node is automatically freed, when the 
         TDomImplementation object is being destroyed. 
         However the document can be freed explicitly by 
         calling its Free method.

      Exceptions:
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if there is no TDomImplementation component 
         associated with this TXmlToDomParser component.
      - EParserException
         Raised if the external resource could not be 
         retreived or if the parser stumbles over a 
         non-wellformed entity in the XML document. Note 
         that not every violation of a wellformedness 
         constraint as defined in [XML 1.0] can be detected

    function ParseWithContext(const InputSource: TXmlInputSource;
                              const ContextNode: TDomNode;
                              const Action: TXmlParserAction): TDomNode; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Parses an XML fragment from a TXmlInputSource 
      object and insert the content into an existing 
      Document Object Model tree at the position 
      specified with the ContextNode and Action 
      parameters. 

      If the context node is a TDomDocument node and the 
      action is ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN, then the 
      document that is passed as the context node will 
      be changed such that its XmlEncoding, DocumentURI, 
      XmlVersion, InputEncoding, XmlStandalone, and all
      other such properties are set to what they would be 
      set to if the input source was parsed using the
      Parse function.

      If an exception is raised while inserting the 
      content into the Document Object Model tree the
      effect of the insertion is undefined. A part of the
      content might have been inserted; if the
      Action is ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN the child nodes
      (or a part of them) might have been removed and 
      freed. Nevertheless, the context node will be
      still in place.

      Parameters:
      - InputSource
         The TXmlInputSource object from which the source
         document is to be read. The source document must 
         be an XML fragment, i.e. anything except a 
         complete XML document (except in the case where 
         the context node of type TDomDocument, and the 
         action is ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN), a DOCTYPE
         (internal subset), entity declaration(s), 
         notation declaration(s), or XML or text 
         declaration(s).
      - ContextNode
         The node that is used as the context for the
         data that is being parsed. This node must be a 
         TDomDocument node, a TDomDocumentFragment node, 
         or a node of a type that is allowed as a child 
         of a TDomElement node, e.g. it cannot be an 
         TDomAttribute node.
      - Action
         This parameter describes which action should be 
         taken between the new set of nodes being 
         inserted and the existing children of the 
         context node. The set of possible actions is as
         follows:

         ACTION_APPEND_AS_CHILDREN:
           Append the result of the parse operation as 
           children of the context node. For this action
           to work, the context node must be a 
           TDomElement or a DocumentFragment node.
         ACTION_INSERT_AFTER:
           Insert the result of the parse operation as 
           the immediately following sibling of the 
           context node. For this action to work the 
           context nodes parent must be a TDomElement
           or a TDomDocumentFragment node.
         ACTION_INSERT_BEFORE:
           Insert the result of the parse operation as 
           the immediately preceding sibling of the
           context node. For this action to work the 
           context nodes parent must be a TDomElement
           or a TDomDocumentFragment node.
         ACTION_REPLACE:
           Replace the context node with the result of 
           the parse operation and free the context node.
           For this action to work, the context node 
           must have a parent, and the parent must be a 
           TDomElement or a TDomDocumentFragment node.
         ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN:
           Replace (and free) all the children of the 
           context node with the result of the parse 
           operation. For this action to work, the 
           context node must be a TDomElement, a 
           TDomDocument, or a TDomDocumentFragment node.

      Return Value:
         The node that is the result of the parse 
         operation. If the result is more than one 
         top-level node, the first one is returned.

      Exceptions:
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if there is no TDomImplementation 
         component associated with this TXmlToDomParser 
         component, or if no TXmlInputSource object or
         no context node is specified.
      - EHierarchy_Request_Err
         Raised if the content cannot replace, replace 
         children, be inserted before, after, or appended
         as a child of the context node (see also 
         TDomNode.InsertBefore or TDomNode.ReplaceChild, 
         etc.)
      - ENo_Modification_Allowed_Err
         Raised if the context node is a read only node 
         and the content is being appended to its child 
         list, or if the parent node of the context node 
         is a read only node and the content is being 
         inserted in its child list.
      - EParserException
         Raised if the parser stumbles over a 
         non-wellformed entity in the XML document. Note 
         that not every violation of a wellformedness 
         constraint as defined in [XML 1.0] can be 
         detected by parsing a document. Some of them can
         only be discovered by validating the document.

    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;

      Creates a new TDtdToDtdModelParser object. Note that
      TDtdToDtdModelParser objects are being created
      automatically when adding them from the component's

      If you derive your own parser class from TXmlToDomParser
      which contain replacements for the original Handlers, 
      Builders and Readers, you must override the protected
      CreateSubcomponents procedure which is called by this
      constructor.

      Parameters:
      - AOwner

         object.

    <literallayout>
      Updates the associated TargetDtdModel object 
      according to the specified document type 
      declaration node.

      Parsing errors are reported to the application via
      the OnError event of the associated TDomImplementation 
      component.  The location information offset is 
      determined by the IntSubsetStartByteNumber, 
      IntSubsetStartCharNumber, IntSubsetStartColumn, and 
      IntSubsetStartLine properties of the specified
      TDomDocumentTypeDecl node.

      Applications may use the OnResolveResource event 
      of the associated TDomImplementation component to 
      redirect references to external resources.
      
      It is not necessary to call Prepare before calling
      the ParseDocTypeDecl function. ParseDocTypeDecl 
      is designed for parsing a complete DTD and thus 
      internally calls Prepare to initialize the parsing 
      process.

      After calling ParseDocTypeDecl, the PreparationStatus 
      property of the associated TargetDtdModel object 
      holds information about whether and to what extent
      the DTD model had been successfully built.

      Hint: If the function reports an invalid character, 
      this is often due to a missing or false text 
      declaration at the beginning of an external entity.  
      Note that you may only skip a text declaration if 
      the external entity is encoded in the default UTF-8
      or UTF-16 encoding.  For all other encodings, e.g. 
      those from the ISO-8859-x family, a text declaration
      is required, for example:
         &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
      when you use the Latin1 character set.

      Parameters:
      - DocTypeDecl
         The TDomDocumentTypeDecl node to be parsed.
      - ResolveExtEntities
         Indicate how the parser should treat external 
         parameter entities and the external subset of
         a DTD.  A value of True indicates that the 
         external subset should be processed as well as
         all references to external parameter entities 
         should be resolved and their replacement text be
         parsed (even if they appear in the internal 
         subset); False indicates that external subset 
         should not be processed and all references to
         external parameter entities in the internal
         subset should either be skipped but subsequent 
         declarations be processed as usual or be ignored 
         and subsequent declarations not be processed but 
         still be checked for wellformedness (which one 
         of these alternatives takes place depents on the 
         value of the Standalone parameter). A value of 
         True is equivalent to the behaviour of a 
         validating processor; a value of False is 
         equivalent to the behaviour of a non-validating 
         processor.
      - InclDecl
         If True, location information for the external
         subset of the DTD includes any text declaration.
         If False, the location information is calculated 
         as if no text declaration had been found.

      Exceptions:
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if there is no TDomImplementation component
         or no TargetDtdModel object associated with this 
         TDtdToDtdModelParser component, or if the specified 
         document type declaration node is nil.
      - EWrong_DOM_Implementation_Err
         Raised if the TDomImplementation object associated
         with this TDtdToDtdModelParser component is not
         identical with the TDomImplementation object 
         associated with the specified TDomDocumentTypeDecl

      Parses the internal subset of a DTD from a

      Note that applications should call Prepare

      performed is a sequel of the previous parsing 
      operation. (For Details, see the description of
      the Prepare method.)

      Parameters:
      - InputSource
         The TXmlSimpleInputSource object to be parsed.
      - Standalone
         Specifies the standalone status of the XML
         document that contains the internal subset
         to be processed.  This is one of the following 
         values:
         STANDALONE_YES
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing a standalone document declaration 
           of value 'yes'.
         STANDALONE_NO
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing a standalone document declaration
           of value 'no'.
         STANDALONE_UNSPECIFIED
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing no standalone document declaration, 
           or there was no declaration found at the
           beginning of the document, or the standalone
           status of the document is unknown.
      - ResolveExtPEs
         Indicate how the parser should behave after a 
         reference to an external parameter entity was 
         encountered. A value of True indicates that 
         such references should be resolved and their
         replacement text be parsed; False indicates that 
         such references should either be skipped but that 
         subsequent declarations should be processed as 
         usual or be ignored and subsequent declarations 
         not be processed but still be checked for 
         wellformedness (which one of these alternatives
         takes place depents on the value of the
         Standalone parameter). A value of True is 
         equivalent to the behaviour of a validating 
         processor; a value of False is equivalent to the
         behaviour of a non-validating processor.

      Exceptions:
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if there is no TDomImplementation component 
         associated with this TDtdToDtdModelParser component, 
         or if no TXmlInputSource object is specified.

    procedure Prepare; virtual;
    <literallayout>
      Advices the TDtdToDtdModelParser component to 
      initialize itself to prepare one or more 
      contiguous parsing operations of a DTD
      subset. Calling Prepare also clears the 
      associated TargetDtdModel object, if any.
      
      When finishing a parsing operation the 
      TDtdToDtdModelParser component keeps some 
      information, for example a list that records the 
      element types of all attribute-list declarations 
      read.  This information is re-used in subsequent
      parsing operation, for example to issue a 
      warning when more than one attribute-list 
      declaration is provided for a given element type.
      Calling Prepare advises the TDtdToDtdModelParser 
      component to discard all information gathered 
      during previous parsing operations.
      
      Applications should call Prepare before 
      calling a parsing method, unless the parsing
      operation to be performed is a sequel of the 
      previous parsing operation.  An example of such
      a sequel is the parsing of an external subset
      of a DTD after parsing its internal subset.  In
      this case the Prepare method must only be
      called before parsing the internal subset:
    </literallayout>
    <programlisting>
        Prepare;
        IntSubsetStringToDtdModel(MyIntInputString,
                         MyPublicId,
                         MySystemId,
                         MyIntSubsetStartByteNumber,
                         MyIntSubsetStartCharNumber,
                         MyIntSubsetStartColumn,
                         MyIntSubsetStartLine,
                         True);
        ExtSubsetStringToDtdModel(MyExtInputString,
                         MyPublicId,
                         MySystemId);
    </programlisting>
    <literallayout>
      It is not necessary to call Prepare before 
      calling the ParseDocTypeDecl function.
      ParseDocTypeDecl is designed for parsing a 
      complete DTD and thus internally calls Prepare
      to initialize the parsing process.

  <title>TDomToXmlParser = class(TXmlCustomParser)</title>

  <para>This component provides functions for serializing (writing) a document tree out in an XML document. Before it can be used a TDomImplementation object must be assigned to its 'DOMImpl' property.  By linking the Unicode Utilities Library (cUnicodeCodecs.pas) the parser supports more then 70 character encoding schemes.  For details consult the documentation of the Unicode Utilities Library.</para>

    <para>
    property BufferSize: Integer;
    <literallayout>
      The buffer size for the internal TXmlOutputSource
      object for serializing the document tree using a
      single byte encoding scheme (for example Latin1 or
      Windows-1252).  When the encoding scheme is UTF-8 
      or UTF-16 the value of BufferSize is irrelevant.

      The value of BufferSize should be a multiplicity of 
      1024.  The default value is 4096.  

      For small files changing the buffer size has almost 
      no measurable effect.  Whereas when parsing large 
      XML files the performance can be increased by using 
      a larger buffer, which of course consumes more memory.
      However, the effect that results from changing the 
      buffer size depends also on the configuration of 
      the computer system used.  The following table shows 
      how long it took to execute the WriteToString(Doc,
      'Latin1', S) function where Doc contains the document
      model of an 798 KB XML version of the ADOM manual (i.e.
      the manual you are just reading) on a Pentium II 233
      with 64 MB RAM on Win98 compiled with Delphi 7
      (average of 5 runs each):

                  Buffer Size  |  Time in ms
               -------------------------------
                      1024     |     2928

      Setting 'UseActiveCodePage' to 'True' is especially
      useful when serializing a DOM tree into a string to
      be displayed on screen.  WriteToString chooses
      automatically the correct encoding.  Of course it
      still cannot serialize DOM trees where a character
      which has no equivalent in the target encoding
      occures in a place where a character reference
      cannot be substituted for it.  In this case the
      return value of the WriteToString function will
      be 'False'.

      This property is only available in Delphi, because
      Kylix strings are based on Unicode encoding.  It 
      is also not available in Delphi for .NET if the

    <literallayout>
      Writes out the specified node into the specified
      destination stream.  Note that the destination
      stream is not automatically cleared, so you can
      append different serialized node trees to the
      same stream.

      Writing a TDomDocument node serializes a complete
      XML document including its XML declaration. Whether
      the output is prefixed by a byte order mark is
      determined by the value of the UseByteOrderMark
      property.  When serializing a node which is not of
      type TDomDocument, byte order marks are never
      used.

      Parameters:
      - WNode
         The node to be serialized.
      - Encoding
         The character encoding in which the output will
         be written.  The encoding to use when writing is
         determined as follows:	 If the UseActiveCodePage
         property of this TDomToXmlParser object is set to
         'True' Window's current active code page is used
         (Delphi only).  Otherwise, if the encoding has
         been specified, that value will be used.  If the
         encoding is an empty string, but the item to be
         written is a TDomDocument node which specifies an
         encoding, that value will be used.  If neither of
         the above provides an encoding name, a default
         encoding of "UTF-8" will be used.
      - Destination
         The destination stream for the data to be written.

      Return Value:
         Returns 'True' if the node was successfully
         serialized and 'False' in case a failure occured.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the specified encoding is not supported.
      - EAccessViolation
         Raised if no TDomImplementation component, no source
         node or no destination stream was specified.

    <literallayout>
      Writes out the specified node into the specified
      string.

      Writing a TDomDocument node serializes a complete
      XML document including its XML declaration. Whether
      the output is prefixed by a byte order mark if the
      specified encoding is UTF-8, is determined by the 
      value of the UseByteOrderMark property.

      Writing other node types produces a fragment of
      text.  Byte order marks are never used.

      Parameters:
      - WNode
         The node to be serialized.
      - Encoding
         The character encoding in which the output will
         be written.  The encoding to use when writing is
         determined as follows:	 If the UseActiveCodePage
         property of this TDomToXmlParser object is set to
         'True' Window's current active code page is used
         (Delphi only).  Otherwise, if the encoding has
         been specified, that value will be used.  If the
         encoding is an empty string, but the item to be
         written is a TDomDocument node which specifies an
         encoding, that value will be used.  If neither of
         the above provides an encoding name, a default
         encoding of 'UTF-8' will be used.
      - S
         The destination string for the data to be written.

      Return Value:
         Returns 'True' if the node was successfully
         serialized and 'False' in case a failure occured.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the specified encoding is not supported.
      - EAccessViolation

<title>Resource Resolver Classes</title>
  
  <para>Resource resolvers provide a way for TDomImplementation components to access external resources.  The resource resolver to be used with a particular TDomImplementation component must be specified in the component's resourceResolver parameter.

  <sect2>
  <title>TCustomResourceResolver = class(TDomBaseComponent)</title>

  <para>This is the abstract base class for all resource resolvers. It defines an abstract ResolveResource function which all derived classes must implement.

            of object;

      This event provides a way for applications to 
      redirect references to external resources.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The parser object that called the event.
      - ResourceType
         The type of the resource being resolved. For XML 
         [XML 1.0] resources (i.e. entities), this is
         "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml", for XML Schema 
         [XML Schema Part 1] this is 
         "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema". [Remark: XML
         Schema is currently not supported by this ADOM 
         implementation.  However, third party parsers
         may do so.]
      - NamespaceUri
         The namespace of the resource being resolved, i.e. 
         the namespace of the XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1]
         when resolving XML Schema resources. [Remark: XML
         Schema is currently not supported by this ADOM 
         implementation.  However, third party parsers
         may do so.]

      Var Parameters:
      - PublicId
         When the event is called this parameter holds the
         public identifier of the external entity to be
         resolved, or an empty WideString, if the public
         identifier is unknown.  An event handler may modify 
         this value, e.g. to normalize public identifiers or 
         to retrieve a public identifier from a system 
         identifier.  The public identifier, if specified, 
         may also be reported as part of the location 
         information when errors are reported.
      - SystemId
         When the event is called this parameter holds the
         system identifier, an absolute URI reference, of 
         the external entity to be resolved, or an empty 
         WideString, if the system identifier is unknown.
         An event method may modify it, e.g. to normalize 
         system identifiers or to retrieve a system 
         identifier if only a public identifier was 
         specified.  
         If the event handler returns 'nil' in the 'stream'
         parameter, the resource resolver tries to open a 
         regular URI connection to the system identifier.  
         In this case, if the system identifier is an empty 
         WideString, the parser aborts resolving the external 
         entity and returns nil.  This is especially useful
         in server applications to prevent parsers from 
         accessing files outside the application's working 
         directory or to implement additional security 
         levels.
         The system identifier is optional if there is a 
         TStream object specified in the 'stream' parameter,
         but it is still useful to provide one, since the
         parser will use it to resolve any relative URIs 
         and can include it in error messages and warnings.
      - Stream
         When the event is called the value of this 
         parameter is nil.  An event handler may return a 
         newly created TStream object which contains the 
         data of the external entity.
      - CertifiedText
         If set to true, assume that the input is certified
         (cf. [XML 1.1], sec. 2.13) when parsing XML 1.1.
         [Remark: This parameter is a place holder, because
         currently ADOM does not support XML 1.1.]

    function ResolveResource(const ABaseURI: WideString;
                               var PublicId,
                                   SystemId: WideString): TStream; override;
    <literallayout>
      Resolves a resource specified by an URI or a public 
      identifier and returns its content in a newly created
      stream object.  When this function is called first
      an OnResolveResource event is triggered.  If this 
      event does not return a stream object and the 
      resulting URI when combining the specified base URI
      and the specified system identifier is a file scheme
      URL, then the resource resolver tries to retrieve this
      resource from the local file system.

      Parameters:
      - ABaseURI
         The base URI of the resource to retrieve.

      Var Parameters:
      - PublicId
         When the function is called this parameter holds 
         the public identifier of the external entity to be
         resolved, or an empty WideString, if the public
         identifier is unknown.  A handler for the
         OnResolveResource event may modify this value, 
         e.g. to normalize public identifiers or to 
         retrieve a public identifier from a system 
         identifier.  The public identifier, if specified, 
         may also be reported as part of the location 
         information when errors are reported.
      - SystemId
         When the function is called this parameter holds 
         the system identifier of the external entity to be 
         resolved, or an empty WideString, if the system 
         identifier is unknown. The function modifies the
         specified system identifier by combining it with
         the specified base URI to calculate an absolute 
         URI.  This absolute URI is next used as the 
         systemId parameter when the OnResolveResource 
         event is triggered.  An event handler may modify
         this value, e.g. to normalize system identifiers 
         or to retrieve a system identifier if only a 
         public identifier was specified.  Then the 
         resulting system identifier is used to locate
         the resource to be retrieved.
          
      Return Value:
         A newly created stream containing the contents of
         resource with the specified URI, or nil if the 
         resource could not be retrieved.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Found_Err
         Raised if no resource resolver assigned was 
         assigned to this TDomImplementation component.

      Resolves a resource specified by an URI or a public 
      identifier via the associated OwnerReader object.
      The content of the resource is returned in a newly 
      created stream object.  

      Parameters:
      - BaseURI
         The base URI of the resource to retrieve.

      Var Parameters:
      - PubId
         When the function is called this parameter holds 
         the public identifier of the external entity to be
         resolved, or an empty WideString, if the public
         identifier is unknown.  The resource resolver
         may modify this value, e.g. to normalize public 
         identifiers or to retrieve a public identifier 
         from a system identifier.  The returned public 
         identifier, if any, may also be reported as part 
         of the location information when errors are reported.
      - SysId
         When the function is called this parameter holds 
         the system identifier of the external entity to be 
         resolved, or an empty WideString, if the system 
         identifier is unknown. The resource resolver 
         may modify this value, e.g. to normalize system 
         identifiers or to retrieve a system identifier if 
         only a public identifier was specified.
          
      Return Value:
         A newly created stream containing the contents of
         resource with the specified URI, or nil if the 
         resource could not be retrieved.

  <title>Input and Output Source Classes</title>

  <para>The classes described in this section are intended for buffered input and output of XML data. Buffering is required for performance reasons: The Tokenizers are analyzing an XML source character by character. Without buffering single bytes would be read from or written to a stream, which tends to be slow, especially on file streams. Buffered reading means that an intermediate object reads ahead larger sequences of bytes from a stream into memory, which is comparatively fast in contrast to reading each byte individually. Likewise, buffered writing means that an intermediate objects caches bytes to be written into a stream in memory until the sequence is large enough to be efficiently written to a stream.</para>

         character in the context of the stream.
      - CharCount: Int64
         The character index of the character in 
         the context of the stream.
      - CharsInLine: Int64
         The number of characters in the line 
         before the character (including the
         character itself) in the context of the
         stream.
      - CodePoint: UCS4Char
         The code point of the character.  
         Immediately after creating a 
         TXmlSimpleInputSource object the value $98

      - Line: Int64
         The line number of the character in the
         context of the stream.
      - Size: Cardinal
         The number of bytes used to encode the
         character.
      - TabsInLine: Int64

         not embedded.

      Exceptions:
      - EConvertError
         Raised if a codec class was specified which does 
         not match the byte order mark (if any) of the input
         stream, or raised if the source stream's first
         character (if any) cannot be converted from the

    function Match(Ucs2Str: WideString): Boolean; virtual; (inherited from TUtilsUCS4Reader)
    <literallayout>
      Advances the current code point as far as the 
      following content of the input stream matches 
      the specified WideString. After calling Match,
      if the specified WideString completely matched
      the following content of the input stream, the
      position of the current code point is that of
      the last matched character. If the following 
      content of the input stream did not completely
      match the specified WideString, the position of
      the current code point after calling Match is 
      that of the first mismatched character.

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character 
      of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlSimpleInputSource object cannot advance the current 
      character beyond this character. The Match 
      function may nevertheless test for STRING 
      TERMINATOR which must appear at the end of the
      specified WideString in order to get a chance 
      for a positive result.

      Parameters:
      - Ucs2Str
         A UCS-2 encoded WideString to be matched.

      Return Value:
         'True' if the specified WideString completely
         matched the following content of the input 
         stream, 'False' otherwise.

      Exceptions:
      - EConvertError
         Raised if the next character(s) of the source 
         stream cannot be converted (according to the 
         current character encoding scheme) to a UCS-4

      calling Next has no effect. If the end of the input
      stream is reached the code point of the current 
      character is set to $9C (STRING TERMINATOR).

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character of 
      code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlSimpleInputSource object cannot advance the current 
      character beyond this character. Note also that
      if the value of the current character is $9C the
      code point returned by the NextChar property is 
      always $9C no matter whether the end of the input 
      stream was reached or not.

      Exceptions:

    procedure SkipNext(Ucs2Str: WideString); virtual; (inherited from TUtilsUCS4Reader)

      Advances the current character to the next
      character (if any) of the input stream while 
      skipping any UCS-2 character contained in 
      ucs2Str. If the code point of the current 
      character is $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) calling 
      SkipNext has no effect. If the end of the 
      input stream is reached the code point of 
      the current character is set to $9C (STRING
      TERMINATOR).

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character
      of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlSimpleInputSource object cannot advance the 
      current character beyond this character. 
      Including $9C in the ucs2Str parameter has no 
      effect. Note also that if the value of the 
      current character is $9C the code point 
      returned by the NextChar property is always 
      $9C no matter whether the end of the input 
      stream was reached or not.

      Parameters:
      - Ucs2Str
         A UCS-2 encoded WideString containing all 
         the characters to be skipped. Repeating a 
         character should be avoided if performance 
         is important. Including STRING TERMINATOR 
         ($9C) in the list of characters to be 
         skipped has no effect, i.e. STRING 
         TERMINATOR appearing in the input stream
         will always terminates SkipNext.

      Exceptions:
      - EConvertError
         Raised if the next character of the source
         stream cannot be converted (according to 
         the current character encoding scheme) to 
         a UCS-4 code point.

      declaration or text declaration.  If no such declaration
      but a byte order mark (BOM) is found the position is set
      immediately behind the BOM.  If also no BOM is found
      the postition is set to the first byte of the stream.

      Parameters:
      - Stream
         A stream that contains the text of the input
         source.

         determined with the help of the input stream's 
         byte order mark or set to the default UTF-8
         encoding, if no byte order mark was found.
      - InclDecl
         If True, location information includes any XML
         or text declaration at the beginning of the 
         associated stream.  If False, the location 
         information is calculated as if no XML or text
         declaration had been found.
      - InitialByteCount

         stream in an embeding XML document, or '0' if 
         the stream is not embedded.
      - InitialCharCount
         The character index offset for the first character 
         of the stream in an embeding XML document (i.e. 
         the index of the first character minus 1), or '0' 
         if the stream is not embedded.
      - InitialCharsInLine
         The number of characters in the line before the first 
         character of the stream in an embeding XML document,
         or '0' if the stream is not embedded.
      - InitialTabsInLine
         The number of TAB characters (#0009) in the line 
         before the first character of the stream in an 
         embeding XML document, or '0' if the stream is not 
         embedded.
      - InitialLine
         The line of the first character of the stream in 
         an embeding XML document, or '1' if the stream is 
         not embedded.

      Exceptions:
      - ENot_Supported_Err
         Raised if the input stream contains an XML 
         declaration or text declaration which specifies
         an encoding which is not supported.
      - EConvertError
         Raised if an encoding was specified (as value of 
         the ACodecClass parameter or in the XML declaration 
         or text declaration) which does not match the byte 
         order mark (if any) of the input stream, or raised 
         if the source stream's first character (if any)

    function Match(Ucs2Str: WideString): Boolean; virtual; (inherited from TUtilsUCS4Reader)
    <literallayout>
      Advances the current code point as far as the 
      following content of the input stream matches 
      the specified WideString. After calling Match,
      if the specified WideString completely matched
      the following content of the input stream, the
      position of the current code point is that of
      the last matched character. If the following 
      content of the input stream did not completely
      match the specified WideString, the position of
      the current code point after calling Match is 
      that of the first mismatched character.

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character 
      of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlInputSource object cannot advance the 
      current character beyond this character. The
      Match function may nevertheless test for 
      STRING TERMINATOR which must appear at the end 
      of the specified WideString in order to get a 
      chance for a positive result.

      Parameters:
      - Ucs2Str

      Return Value:
         'True' if the specified WideString completely

      Exceptions:
      - EConvertError
         Raised if the next character(s) of the source 
         stream cannot be converted (according to the

      calling Next has no effect. If the end of the input

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character of 
      code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlInputSource object cannot advance the current 
      character beyond this character. Note also that

      Advances the current character to the next

      skipping any UCS-2 character contained in 
      ucs2Str. If the code point of the current

      SkipNext has no effect. If the end of the 
      input stream is reached the code point of 
      the current character is set to $9C (STRING
      TERMINATOR).

      Hint: If the input stream contains a character
      of code point $9C (STRING TERMINATOR) the 
      TXmlInputSource object cannot advance the 
      current character beyond this character. 
      Including $9C in the ucs2Str parameter has no 
      effect. Note also that if the value of the 
      current character is $9C the code point 
      returned by the NextChar property is always 
      $9C no matter whether the end of the input 
      stream was reached or not.

      Parameters:
      - Ucs2Str
         A UCS-2 encoded WideString containing all 
         the characters to be skipped. Repeating a 
         character should be avoided if performance 
         is important. Including STRING TERMINATOR 
         ($9C) in the list of characters to be 
         skipped has no effect, i.e. STRING 
         TERMINATOR appearing in the input stream
         will always terminates SkipNext.

      Exceptions:
      - EConvertError
         Raised if the next character of the source
         stream cannot be converted (according to 
         the current character encoding scheme) to

      initializes it with a WideString.

      Parameters:
      - S
         An UTF-16LE encoded WideString (with or 
         without a byte order mark) holding the 
         document type declaration to be analyzed.
      - DocumentUri
         The location of the XML document that embeds 
         the document type declaration or an empty 
         WideString if undefined or if the Document 
         was created by the user.
      - InitialByteCount
         The byte offset of the first character of 
         the document type declaration in an embeding
         XML document, or '0' if the document type 
         declaration is not embedded.
      - InitialCharCount
         The character index offset for the first 
         character of the document type declaration 
         in an embeding XML document (i.e. the index 
         of the first character minus 1), or '0' if 
         the document type declaration is not embedded.
      - InitialCharsInLine
         The number of characters in the line before the 
         first character of the  document type declaration
         in an embeding XML document, or '0' if the 
         document type declaration is not embedded.
      - InitialTabsInLine
         The number of TAB characters (#0009) in the 
         line before the first character of the 
         document type declaration in an embeding XML 
         document, or '0' if the document type 
         declaration is not embedded.
      - InitialLine
         The line of the first character of the 
         document type declaration in an embeding XML 
         document, or '1' if the document type

  <title>The XML Processor Pipeline</title>
    <para>To implement XML parsing ADOM follows the so-called "processor pipeline" design pattern. The task of parsing an XML document is devided into several subsequent phases, each performed by an individual component. These components are forming a pipeline or queue, through which XML Signal objects are propagated. The components in the pipeline evaluate or manipulate this XML Signals, may stop the whole process by raising exceptions, pass the XML Signals to the next component in the pipeline, or may react on the recieved XML Signals in a special way.</para>

    <para>Each processor pipeline starts with a Reader.  The Reader is usually inizialized with some kind of an XML source, for example an XML character stream represented by a TXmlInputSource object.  The Reader analyzes its associated XML source by executing basic wellformedness tests and subsequently creating XML Signals and passing them to a Signal Handler.  After receiving and processing an XML Signal a Signal Handler passes it to the next Signal Handler in the pipeline, if any:</para>

    <literallayout><emphasis>
 Reader ---signal---> Handler_1 ---signal---> Handler_2 ---signal--> ...
    </emphasis></literallayout>

    <para>The standard way to cope with errors detected while processing an XML document is using a call-back to the Reader: The Signal Handler detecting the error sends an error notification back to the Reader.  The Reader passes this query to its associated TDomImplementation component, if any, by calling the TDomImplementation.handleError method.  Then the TDomImplementation.handleError method queries the application via the TDomImplementation.OnError event, if an event handler is provided.  This makes it easy for an application to record error notifications and to influence the behavior of a parser by modifying the 'go' var-parameter of the OnError event.</para>
  
    <para>If in the above example Handler_2 detects an error, the error notification process according to the standard processing model is as follows:</para>

    <literallayout><emphasis>
 Handler_2 ---notifies--> Reader ---notifies---> Implementation ---triggers---> OnError-Event
    </emphasis></literallayout>

    <para>If the 'go' parameter of the OnError event returns 'False', the Reader raises an EParserException. If no TDomImplementation component is associated with the Reader or if an associated TDomImplementation component does not specify a handler for the HandleError event, the behavior of the Reader depents on the severity of the error: If the error is an XML Fatal Error (DOM_SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR) an EParserException is raised, otherwise no special operation is performed.</para>   
  
    <para>If an exception is raised this exception travels back through the Signal Handler pipeline:</para>

    <literallayout><emphasis>
  Reader ---exception---> Handler_2 ---exception---> Handler_1 ---exception---> Reader
    </emphasis></literallayout>

    <para>Any of the Signal Handlers may catch the exception and thus prevent it from reaching the Reader again. When nevertheless the exception reaches the Reader, the Reader usually will terminate the XML processing. In that case, the Reader passes an XML Aborted Signal to the first Signal Handler in the pipeline.  This tells the Signal Handler to reset itself and afterwards to pass the XML Aborted Signal to the next Signal Handler in the pipeline. When defining a new Signal Handler class, override the ProcessSignal method, so that the Signal Handler can recover when the processing of an XML source was aborted, and make sure that the Signal Handler passes afterwards the XML Aborted Signal to the next Signal Handler in the pipeline.</para>

    <para>Note that special, non-standard Signal Handlers or Readers may implement a different behavior, such as raising an Exception without notification, silently skipping invalid data or on receiving an exception may nevertheless decide to continue processing or to send modified XML Signals.  Also the standard Signal Handlers and Readers may ignore the signal to continue processing after a fatal error occured if they are unable to recover from an unstable state.</para>
  
    <para>The default behavior of ADOM's standard pipeline components is to continue on warnings and errors (if possible), and to stop on fatal errors.  It is recommended to follow this paradigm when implementing your own Reader and Signal Handler classes, unless a different behavior is mandatory.</para>

    <para>If a Reader passes an XML Signal to a Signal Handler it will be valid only during the scope of each Signal Handler's ProcessSignal method. The application will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use such an XML Signal (or any of its property objects) at any other time. However, an application may call the CloneSignal function of an XML Signal to create a copy of it which is then maintained by the application.</para>
  
    <para>Reader classes should, but are not required to supply a Locator with an XML Signal.</para>

    <para>ADOM includes a variety of different Reader and Signal Handler components.  They can be combined in alternative ways to construct a special purpose XML processor by placing them on a Delphi form, connecting them with the help of the Object Inspector and writing special event handlers to manipulate XML Signals. Developers may use any of these classes to derive their own special purpose Readers or Signal Handlers.</para>

  <title>The Difference Between the ADOM Processor Pipeline and SAX</title>

    <para>Today,the most popular API design for lightweight XML processing is David Megginson's Simple API for XML (SAX, see: "http://www.megginson.com/SAX/").  It was originally developed for Java, but later ported to many other programming languages, including Delphi/Kylix.  SAX is based on handlers for XML parsing events.  Similar to ADOM, a SAX Reader, when processing an XML document, subsequently calls notification methods of a SAX Handler.  But in contrast to ADOM, a SAX Handler must provide an extra handler method with a different set of parameters for each kind of parsing events.  For example, a typical handler method to receive notification of an XML processing instruction in a Delphi/Kylix SAX implementation may look like this:</para>
    
    <literallayout>
    procedure HandleProcessingInstruction(
      const Target, Data: WideString);
    </literallayout>

    <para>and a handler method for XML Text data might look like this:</para>
    
    <literallayout>
    procedure HandleCharacters(const S: WideString);
    </literallayout>

    <para>In contrast to SAX, ADOM's design of its parsing pipeline follows more closely an object-oriented paradigm. While a typical SAX handler must implement at least eleven methods with different parameter sets (and perhaps even more, if it is a non-standard implementation), ADOM's Signal Handlers use only one method with one parameter:</para>
    
    <literallayout>
    procedure ProcessSignal(
      const Signal: TXmlSignal);
    </literallayout>

    <para>This clear design of hiding the details of a notification in an XML Signal object makes writing handlers more compact and adding new XML Signal types comparatively easy (see for example the source code of the TXmlStandardHandler class).</para>

<title>List Classes</title>

  <para>ADOM contains the following specialist classes to maintaine a list of Signal Handlers.</para>

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
    <para>TXmlHandlers = class(TCollection)</para>
    <para>Used in TXmlDistributor to maintaine a collection of TXmlCustomHandler. To add a new item to the collection use its Add function which returns a new TXmlHandlerItem object and use the XmlHandler property of this new TXmlHandlerItem object to point to the TXmlCustomHandler object to be associated. Code example:</para>
    <literallayout>
    MyXmlHandlers.Add.XmlHandler:= MyXmlCustomHandler;
    </literallayout>
    <para>From a collection single items cannot be removed. It is only possible to remove and free all items as a whole using the 'clear' command. If you need to remove a single reference to a Handler from the collection, then set the XmlHandler property of the respective collection item to 'nil. Code example:</para>
    <literallayout>
    MyXmlHandlers.Items[42].XmlHandler:= nil;
    </literallayout>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
    <para>TXmlHandlerItem = class(TCollectionItem)</para>
    <para>Used in TXmlHandlers to represent one item of the collection. Use its XmlHandler property to point to the associated TXmlCustomHandler.</para>

<title>XML Signal Classes</title>

  <para>An XML Signal object represents a piece of XML data suitable for being processed individually.  An XML Signal object is typically created by a Reader and passed through a processor pipeline by recursive calls of the ProcessSignal methods of the Signal Handlers in the pipeline. After the ProcessSignal method called by the Reader completed the Reader destroys the XML Signal object it had created.</para>

      Analyzes an XML document (but not its DTD) provided
      by the specified InputSource by splitting it into
      its structure units such as tags, text, comments,
      etc.  For each of this structure units the 
      ProcessSignal function of the specified NextHandler,
      if any, is called, passing an appropriate XML Signal 
      object.  
      
      The first signal sent is always an 
      XmlStartDocumentSignal object; the last signal
      sent is a TXmlCompletedSignal object.  If the 
      parsing was aborted, for example due to a fatal 
      error in the XML source code, a TXmlAbortedSignal
      object is sent instead of a TXmlCompletedSignal 
      object.

      If ErrorReportingEnabled is True, errors, fatal 
      errors and warnings are reported to the associated 
      TDomImplementation object (if any) that subsequently
      triggers an OnError event. 

      Parameters:
      - InputSource
         The TXmlInputSource object containing the
         document entity to process.

      Return Value:
         Returns True if the XML document has been

      by splitting it into its structure units such as
      tags, text, comments, etc.  For each of this 
      structure units the ProcessSignal function of 
      the specified NextHandler, if any, is called, 
      passing an appropriate XML Signal object.  
      
      The first signal sent is always an 
      XmlStartDocumentFragmentSignal object; the last 
      signal sent is a TXmlCompletedSignal object.  If 
      the parsing was aborted, for example due to a fatal 
      error in the XML source code,  a TXmlAbortedSignal
      object is sent instead of a TXmlCompletedSignal 
      object.

      The fragment to be parsed must match the well-
      formedness rules for "Content of Elements" as
      specified in [XML 1.0], sect. 3.1, prod. [43].

      If ErrorReportingEnabled is True, errors, fatal 
      errors and warnings are reported to the associated

      For each of this structure units the ProcessSignal
      function of the specified NextHandler, if any,
      is called, passing an appropriate XML Signal 
      object.  

      The first signal to be sent is always an 
      XmlStartIntDtdSignal object; the last signal
      sent is a TXmlCompletedSignal object.  If the 
      parsing was aborted, for example due to a fatal 
      error in the XML source code,  a TXmlAbortedSignal
      object is sent instead of a TXmlCompletedSignal

      before calling a parsing method, unless the 
      parsing operation to be performed is a sequel of 
      the previous parsing operation. (For Details, 
      see the description of the Prepare method.)

      Parameters:
      - InputSource
         The TXmlInputSource object containing the
         internal subset of a DTD to process.
      - Standalone
         Specifies the standalone status of the XML
         document that contains the internal subset
         to be processed.  This is one of the following 
         values:
         STANDALONE_YES
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing a standalone document declaration 
           of value 'yes'.
         STANDALONE_NO
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing a standalone document declaration
           of value 'no'.
         STANDALONE_UNSPECIFIED
           The document starts with an XML declaration
           containing no standalone document declaration, 
           or there was no declaration found at the
           beginning of the document, or the standalone
           status of the document is unknown.
      - ResolveExtPEs
         If True, references to external parameter 
         entities are automatically resolved and 
         their replacement text is parsed. If False, 
         references to external parameter entities 
         are not resolved; instead a 
         TXmlExternalPEReferenceSignal is sent.

      Return Value:
         Returns True if the internal subset has been
         processed without errors or fatal erros, 
         otherwise False is returned.

    procedure Prepare; virtual;

      Advices the Reader to initialize itself to
      prepare one or more contiguous parsing operations.

      When finishing a parsing operation the Reader
      keeps some information, for example a list that
      records the element types of all attribute-list 
      declarations read.  This information is re-used
      in the following parsing operation, for example
      to issue a warning when more than one 
      attribute-list declaration is provided for a 
      given element type.  Calling Prepare
      advises the Reader to discard all information
      gathered during previous parsing operations.
      
      Applications should call Prepare before 
      calling a parsing method, unless the parsing
      operation to be performed is a sequel of the 
      previous parsing operation.  An example of such
      a sequel is the parsing of an external subset
      of a DTD after parsing its internal subset.  In
      this case the Prepare method must only be
      called before parsing the internal subset:

        Prepare;

      Sending the ID value is especially useful when 
      parsing a non namespace-aware into a namespace-
      aware document tree, since the latter does not
      provide a method to automatically identify ID
      attributes. Note that in this case the

      It is not recommended to set this property to

      the Elements' ID values, because calculating 
      the ID values is time consuming.

  <para>A TXmlStandardHandler object propagates the XML Signals it receives via its PocessSignal procedure to the TXmlCustomHandler object specified in its NextHandler property.  Before a TXmlStandardHandler propagates the XML Signal it triggers an OnSignal event.  An application may provide an event handler for the OnSignal event to evaluate or modify the TXmlSignal instance before it is further propagated or to stop the propagation of the Signal.</para>

                   of object;

      This event is triggered whenever the 
      TXmlStandardHandler receives an XML Signal
      object to be processed.  The event passes 
      the TXmlSignal object to the application
      before it is passed to the associated
      TXmlCustomHandler object specified in the
      NextHandler property.  An application may
      provide an event handler for the OnSignal 
      event to evaluate or modify the TXmlSignal 
      instance before it is further propagated or
      to stop the propagation of the Signal.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The object that called the event, i.e. this
         TXmlStreamBuilder object.
      - Signal
         The TXmlSignal object to be processed.

      Var Parameters:
      - Accept
         This parameter is initially set to 'True'.
         An application may change it to 'False'
         in order to stop the propagation of the
         Signal.

                    Signal: TXmlSignal) 
                   of object;

      This event is triggered after the 
      TXmlStandardHandler received and processed
      an XML Signal object, i.e. after it was 
      passed to the associated TXmlCustomHandler 
      object specified in the NextHandler 
      property.  An application may provide an 
      event handler for the OnSignal event to 
      evaluate and react to the TXmlSignal instance.
      An OnSignaled event is triggered even if an 
      event Handler for the corresponding OnSignal 
      event set the Accept parameter to False.
      
      Hint: Note that a Signal might be modified by
      an OnSignal event handler or by any 
      TXmlCustomHandler object in the subordinated 
      processing pipeline.  In this case, the 
      properties of the Signal passed by the 
      OnSignaled event differ from the properties of
      the Signal passed by the OnSignal event, even
      though both Signals are the same object.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         The object that called the event, i.e. this
         TXmlStreamBuilder object.
      - Signal
         The TXmlSignal object to be processed.

      Tests whether the specified TXmlSignal object
      represents a wellformed unit of XML or DTD 
      code.
      
      By default, if an XML fatal error is detected 
      the component informs the application about
      the fatal error, as described above, and then 
      stops to propagate the XML Signal to the next 
      handler and raises an EParserException.  

      By default, if an XML error or warning is 
      detected the component informs the application 
      about the error or warning, as described above, 
      but continues to propagate the XML Signal to
      the Signal Handler specified by NextHandlers, 
      if any, calling its ProcessSignal procedure. 

      If neither a fatal error, nor an error, nor a
      warning is detected, the XML Signal is passed
      to the Signal Handler specified by NextHandlers, 
      if any, calling its ProcessSignal procedure.

      If an error is detected, the application is 
      informed about it, as described above, and may
      alter the default behavior.

      - Signal
         The TXmlSignal object to be processed.

      Modifies the procession of element and attribute
      Signals in an XML Signal pipeline.
      
      Processing TXmlStartElementSignal and accompanying 
      TXmlAttributeSignal objects is delayed until 
      another XML Signal has been received.  Then,
      if the PrefixMapping flag is 'True', for each
      attribute Signal received which contains a 
      namespace declaration its corresponding 
      TXmlStartPrefixMappingSignal objects is sent.  
      Next, a TXmlStartElementSignal object is sent 
      which is equivalent to the TXmlStartElementSignal
      object received before.  
      Finally, TXmlAttributeSignal objects are sent 
      which are equivalent to the TXmlAttributeSignal 
      objects received before.  If the SuppressXmlns 
      flag is 'True' all TXmlAttributeSignal objects 
      are skipped which contain a namespace declaration.
      
      After processing a TXmlEndElementSignal object,
      if the PrefixMapping flag is 'True', a
      TXmlEndPrefixMappingSignal object is sent for
      each prefix mapping of the corresponding start
      element.

      All other Signals are passed unaltered to the 
      Signal Handler specified by 'NextHandlers', if 
      any, calling its ProcessSignal procedure.

      - dtCheckValidity:
         A TDomDocumentTypeDecl node is inserted into the

      The node relative to which the next ProcessSignal

      ProcessSignal call the value of ReferenceNode may
      change. If ReferenceNode is 'nil' no new nodes 
      will be attached.

      If the RootDocument document of the 
      ReferenceNode is of type TDomDocumentNS (or of a 
      type derived from TDomDocumentNS), the DOM tree 
      is built using namespace element and attribute 
      nodes.  If the RootDocument document of the 
      ReferenceNode is of type TDomDocument, the DOM tree
      is built using non-namespace element and attribute 
      nodes.

      Information about the prefix to namespace-URI
      mapping reaches the builder through
      TXmlStartPrefixMappingSignal and 
      TXmlEndPrefixMappingSignal objects.
      TXmlDomBuilder performs only basic namespace
      validity tests, so applications are adviced to
      process only valid XML-namespace documents.
      (Complete tests are postponed to a future ADOM
      release.)  In the current ADOM release the only
      component which provides the necessary
      TXmlStartPrefixMappingSignal and 
      TXmlEndPrefixMappingSignal objects
      is the TXmlStandardDomReader component.  So for
      to parse an XML document into a namespace-aware
      DOM tree first parse the XML document into an
      ordinary DOM tree, validate it and resolve its
      entity reference nodes if necessary, and finally
      use a TXmlStandardDomReader with its
      PrefixMappping and SignalElementID properties 
      set to 'True' to call a TXmlDomBuilder with its
      BuildIDList property set to 'True' and with a 
      ReferenceNode of type TDomDocumentNS (or

      Parameters: 
      - Signal
         The TXmlSignal object to be processed.

      Exceptions:
         During signal processing, any type of 
         exception may be raised, if the signal

<title>TXmlStreamBuilder = class(TXmlCustomHandler)</title>

  <para>A TXmlStreamBuilder component is used to serialize (write) out an XML document or a fragment of it into a stream via a TXmlOutputSource object.  It receives informations about the structure elements of a DOM tree and reports serious errors as described above. If another ContentHandler is specified in the NextHandler property, then after succesfully evaluating the information, i.e. if no serious error was detected, the appropriate function of this Handler is called.</para>

  <para>Before a TXmlStreamBuilder component can be used it must be associated with a TXmlOutputSource object at runtime.  Here is an example:</para>

  <programlisting>
  MyStream := TStream.Create;
  try
    MyOutputSrc := TXmlOutputSource.Create(MyStream, 4096);
    try
      MyXmlStreamBuilder.OutputSource := MyOutputSrc;
      ... // Do the parsing here.
      MyOutputSrc.Flushbuffer;
      ... // Do stream operations either here
    finally
      // First, set the OutputSource property to nil !!!
      MyXmlStreamBuilder.OutputSource:= nil;
      MyOutputSrc.Free;
    end;
    ...   // or do stream operations here.
  finally
    MyStream.Free;
  end;
  </programlisting>

  <para>Hints:  (i) The buffer size specified when creating the TXmlOutputSource object should be a multiplicity of 1024.  (ii) To synchronize the buffer of the TXmlOutputSource object with the Stream use the TXmlOutputSource.flushbuffer method.  When you free the TXmlOutputSource object this synchronization is done implicitly.  Therefore you must not free the Stream before the TXmlOutputSource object.  (iii) Before you free the TXmlOutputSource you must set the 'outputSource' property of its associated TXmlStreamBuilder to nil.  (iv) The destination stream is not cleared by any of TXmlStreamBuilder's methods, so you can append different serialized node trees to the same stream.</para>

      is contained in the set.  When using other encodings
      a byte order mark is never used.
      
      The default value is [bomUTF16, bomUCS2], i.e. a byte
      order mark is used when the encoding is UTF-16BE,

<title>TDomNodeIterator = class(#)</title>

  <para>A TDomNodeIterator objects allows the members of a list of nodes to be returned sequentially. This list will always consist of the nodes of a subtree, presented in document order. When an iterator is first created, calling its NextNode method returns the first node in the logical view of the subtree; in most cases, this is the root of the subtree. Each successive call advances the NodeIterator through the list, returning the next node available in the logical view. When no more nodes are visible, NextNode returns nil.</para>

  <para> TDomNodeIterator objects are created using the createNodeIterator method found in the document classes. When an iterator is created, a set of flags can be used to determine which node types will be "visible" and which nodes will be "invisible" while traversing the tree. Nodes that are "invisible" are skipped over by the iterator as though they did not exist.</para>

    property expandEntityReferences: Boolean (readonly)

      The value of this flag determines whether the children

      rejected.  Note that this rejection takes precedence over
      whatToShow and the filter. Also note that this is currently
      the only situation where Iterators may reject a complete
      subtree rather than skipping individual nodes.

      To produce a view of the document that has entity
      references expanded and does not expose the entity
      reference node itself, use the whatToShow flags to hide
      the entity reference node and set expandEntityReferences
      to true when creating the iterator. To produce a view of
      the document that has entity reference nodes but no
      entity expansion, use the whatToShow flags to show the

      false.

  <sect1>
  <title>TDomTreeWalker = class(#)</title>

  <para>The TDomTreeWalker class provides many of the same benefits as the TDomNodeIterator class. The main difference between these two classes is that the TreeWalker presents a tree-oriented view of the nodes in a subtree, rather than the Iterator's list-oriented view. In other words, an Iterator allows you to move forward or back, but a TreeWalker allows you to also move to the parent of a node, to one of its children, or to a sibling.</para>

  <para>Using a TreeWalker is quite similar to navigation using the node directly, and the navigation methods for the two classes are analogous. The advantage of using a TreeWalker instead of direct Node navigation is that the TreeWalker allows the user to choose an appropriate view of the tree. Flags may be used to show or hide Comments or ProcessingInstructions; entities may be expanded or shown as EntityReference nodes. In addition, TDomNodeFilter objects may be used to present a custom view of the tree.</para>

  <para>Omitting nodes from the logical view of a subtree can result in a structure that is substantially different from the same subtree in the complete, unfiltered document. Nodes that are siblings in the TreeWalker view may be children of different, widely separated nodes in the original view. For instance, consider a Filter that skips all nodes except for Text nodes and the root node of a document. In the logical view that results, all text nodes will be siblings and appear as direct children of the root node, no matter how deeply nested the structure of the original document.</para>

      traversal occurs relative to currentNode even if it is

  <title>TDomNodeFilter = class(#)</title>

  <para> TDomNodeFilter allow the user to create objects that "filter out" nodes. Each filter contains a user-written function that looks at a node and determines whether or not it should be presented as part of the traversal's logical view of the document. To use a TDomNodeFilter, you create a TDomNodeIterator or a TDomTreeWalker that uses the filter. The traversal engine applies the filter to each node, and if the filter does not accept the node, traversal skips over the node as though it were not present in the document. NodeFilters need not know how to navigate the structure that contains the nodes on which they operate.</para>

  <para>Filters will be consulted when a traversal operation is performed, or when a TDomNodeIterator's reference node is removed from the subtree being iterated over and it must select a new one. However, the exact timing of these filter calls may vary from one ADOM release to another. For that reason, TDomNodeFilters should not attempt to maintain state based on the history of past invocations; the resulting behavior may not be portable.</para>

  <para>Similarly, TDomTreeWalkers and TDomNodeIterators should behave as if they have no memory of past filter results, and no anticipation of future results. If the conditions a TDomNodeFilter is examining have changed (e.g., an attribute which it tests has been added or removed) since the last time the traversal logic examined this node, this change in visibility will be discovered only when the next traversal operation is performed. For example: if the filtering for the current node changes from filter_accept to filter_skip, a TDomTreeWalker will be able to navigate off that node in any direction, but not back to it unless the filtering conditions change again. TDomNodeFilters which change during a traversal can be written, but their behavior may be confusing and they should be avoided when possible.</para>

<title>The XPath Implementation (+)</title>

<para>The [XPath 1.0] specification defines a language whose main purpose is to address parts of an XML document. ADOM supports the evaluation of XPath expressions on document trees of type TDomDocumentXPath.</para>

  <sect1>
  <title>The XPath Document Model</title>

  <para>The XPath language models an XML document as a tree of nodes represented in ADOM by the TDomDocumentXPath class. This XPath data model is similar to, but not identical with the standard ADOM document model. The main differences are as follows:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>The XPath model relies on the XML information set as specified in [XML Infoset]. XML documents that do not conform to [XML Namespaces] are not considered to have meaningful information sets (see [XML Infoset], sec. 1.). Therefore, the XPath data model has to be namespace-aware.</para></listitem>
  
  <listitem><para>The XPath model does not include a representation for document type declarations, entity references and CDATA sections. Therefore, a TDomDocumentXPath object does not support the creation of respective node types.  When creating a document tree according to the XPath data model, document type declarations must be omitted, and entity references and CDATA sections must be resolved into Text nodes.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The XPath model represents character information items in a single logical Text node where an ADOM document tree may have multiple fragmented nodes due to CDATA sections, entity references, etc. Therefore, ADOM supports only the evaluation of XPath expressions on normalized document trees, although it does, for performance reasons, not prohibit the application to create documents with adjacent Text nodes and to use XPath expressions on such non normalized document trees. However, doing so may produce erroneous results and thus is strongly discouraged.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The XPath model expects namespace nodes for each in-scope namespace to be attached to each element. ADOM only maintains the declaration of namespaces instead of replicating them on each Element where they are in-scope. The ADOM implementation of XPath returns a new TDomXPathNamespace node to properly preserve identity and ordering. This node type is only visible using the XPath evaluation methods.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>In the XPath model there are no attribute nodes corresponding to attributes that declare namespaces. Nevertheless, in the ADOM XPath implementation such attributes must be represented in the document tree as ordinary TDomAttr nodes. When evaluating an XPath expression these nodes are only used for prefix-namespace lookup, but otherwise do not count as attribute nodes. An application should not trigger an XPath evaluation with such an attribute node as its context node.</para></listitem>

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The document order of nodes in the ADOM Core has been defined to be compatible with the XPath document order. The XPath document model is extending the document order of the DOM Core to include the TDomXPathNamespace nodes. Element nodes occur before their children. The attribute nodes and namespace nodes of an element occur before the children of the element. The namespace nodes are defined to occur before the attribute nodes. The relative order of namespace nodes is arbitrary. The relative order of attribute nodes is arbitrary.</para>

  <para>The TXPathExpression.ContextNode property excepts only nodes whose root document is of type TDomDocumentXPath. For performance reasons, other XPath methods which include a parameter of type TDomNode do not verify the type of the specified node's root document. Nevertheless, it is strongly discouraged to pass nodes of a non XPath document tree to these methods, because it may produce unpredictable results in this or future ADOM releases.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>Performing XPath Evaluations</title>

  <para>Important: XPath evaluations should only be performed on document trees which conform to the XPath Document Model as described in the relevant section of this manual. Also note that the XPath id() function requires that the IDs list of the context node's root document had been initialized.</para>

	<para>To evaluate an XPath expression with a certain context node an application may use the node's EvaluateToBoolean, EvaluateToNumber, EvaluateToNode, or EvaluateToWideString function. For details see the description of the TDomNode class.</para>

	<para>Using this functions is relatively straightforward. For example</para>

<programlisting>ReturnNode := MyNode.EvaluateToNode('child::para[position()=last()]');</programlisting>
	
  <para>returns the last 'para' child element of 'MyNode', or nil if no such element exists.</para>
	
	<para>The evaluate methods from the TDomNode class are easy to apply, but cannot generally be recommended if  performance is an issue.  The reason is that anytime such a method is called the XPath expression must be analyzed again.  What is happening behind the stage is that the expression is parsed into a so-called abstract syntax tree which represents the structure of the expression in a tree of XPath syntax objects. A TXPathExpression object is used to build and maintain this abstract syntax tree. So internally, each of the evaluate methods from the TDomNode class first creates and initializes such a TXPathExpression object, then calls the Evaluate method of this TXPathExpression object which actually performs the XPath evaluation, and finally frees the TXPathExpression object.</para>
	
	<para>If an application repeatedly needs to apply the same XPath expression it is more efficient to use a persistent TXPathExpression component that can be dropped on a form at design-time or created by an application at run-time. Such a TXPathExpression component can reuse its internal abstract syntax tree when applying the same XPath expression on different context nodes. The internal abstract syntax tree is built either the first time the TXPathExpression.Evaluate function is called or at anytime before by calling the TXPathExpression.Prepare function. Here is an example about how to use a run-time constructed TXPathExpression component:</para>
	
<programlisting>
  procedure FindLastPara(const N1, N2: TDomNode;
                           var R1, R2: TDomNode);
  var
    Expr: TXPathExpression;
  begin
    // First, we create the TXPathExpression component
    // (an owner is not required here):
    Expr := TXPathExpression.Create(nil);
    
    try
      // We specify an XPath expression which returns
      // the last 'para' child element of a given
      // context node:
      Expr.Expression := 'child::para[position()=last()]';
      
      // We make N1 the context node:
      Expr.ContextNode := N1;
      
      // We trigger the evaluation of the expression:
      Expr.Evaluate;

      // We pass the first result node to the R1 var
      // parameter. (If there is no result node this 
      // function simply returns 'nil'.)
      R1 := Expr.ResultNode(0);

      // We repeat the same process with the second 
      // context node:
      Expr.ContextNode := N2;
      Expr.Evaluate;
      R2 := Expr.ResultNode(0);

    finally
    
      // Finally, we must free our TXPathExpression
      // component:
      Expr.Free;
      
    end;
  end;
</programlisting>

  <title>Using XPath Variables</title>

  <para>An XPath expression may include variable references which consists in a QName preceded by a $-sign. The prefix of the QName must be bound to a namespace URI via the context node of the expression. An unprefixed variable reference has no associated namespace URI.</para>

  <para>When a variable reference needs to be resolved during XPath evaluation, an OnRequestXPathVariable event is triggered on the TDomImplementation component associated with the context node of the XPath expression.  The application must return a valid TDomXPathCustomResult descendant representing the value the variable reference is bound to. This returned object is then maintained by ADOM and no longer in scope of the application.</para>
  
  <para>For more information see the description of the TDomImplementation.OnRequestXPathVariable event.</para>
  
  </sect1>


  <sect1>
  <title>Using User-defined XPath Functions</title>

  <para>An XPath expression may include user-defined functions. The prefix of the function name must be bound to a namespace URI via the context node of the expression. An unprefixed function name has no associated namespace URI.</para>

  <para>When a user-defined function needs to be processed during XPath evaluation, an OnRequestXPathFunctionResult event is triggered on the TDomImplementation component associated with the context node of the XPath expression. The application must return a valid TDomXPathCustomResult descendant representing the result of the user-defined function. This returned object is then maintained by ADOM and no longer in scope of the application.</para>

            of object;

      This event is triggered during the evaluation of the XPath 
      expression for each of its prefix to allow the application 
      to modify the mapping from prefixes to namespace URIs.

      Note that modifying such mappings is not conforming to the
      [XPath 1.0] specification.  Applications should only use
      this event if strict [XPath 1.0] compliance is not 
      required.

      Parameters:
      - Sender
         This TXPathExpression component.
      - APrefix
         The prefix whose namespace URI is being looked up.

      Var Parameters:
      - ANamespaceURI
         This parameter is initialized with the namespace URI
         as given in the namespace declaration for the prefix
         in the expression context, or with an empty WideString
         if there is no namespace declaration for the prefix in
         the expression context.  An application may modify 
         this parameter to associated a different namespace URI
         with the prefix.

      Befor an XPath expression is evaluated it 
      must internally be parsed into an abstract 
      syntax tree.  This is done automatically 
      the first time the Evaluate function is
      called on a new expression. The Prepare
      function allows an application to build
      the abstract syntax tree at any time 
      before executing the Evaluate function,
      for example when waiting for user input.
      Calling Prepare if the expression was
      already been prepared does nothing.

      Return Value:
         If the internal abstract syntax tree was
         successfully built, 'True' is returned.
         If the expression has a syntax error or

        non-empty.
      - A string is true if and only if its length is
        non-zero.

      Return Value:

      - A string that consists of optional whitespace
        followed by an optional minus sign followed by
        an XPath Number followed by whitespace is 
        converted to the IEEE 754 number that is 
        nearest (according to the IEEE 754 
        round-to-nearest rule) to the mathematical 
        value represented by the string; any other 
        string is converted to NaN.
      - Boolean true is converted to 1; Boolean false 
        is converted to 0.
      - A node-set is first converted to a string as 
        if by a call to the XPath string() function 
        and then converted in the same way as a 
        string argument.

      Return Value:
         The last evaluation result converted into a 
         number.  For invalid node-set results 'NaN'

      Returns the last evaluation result converted
      to a WideString according to the XPath string() 
      function as specified in [XPath 1.0], sec. 4.2:

      - A node-set is converted to a WideString by 
        returning the string-value of the node in the
        node-set that is first in document order. If 
        the node-set is empty, an empty WideString is 
        returned.
      - The Boolean False value is converted to the
        WideString 'False'. The Boolean True value 
        is converted to the string 'True'.
      - A number is converted to a WideString as 
        follows:
        - NaN is converted to the WideString 'NaN'.
        - Positive zero is converted to the 
          WideString '0'.
        - Negative zero is converted to the 
          WideString '0'.
        - Positive infinity is converted to the 
          WideString 'Infinity'.
        - Negative infinity is converted to the 
          WideString '-Infinity'.
        - If the number is an Integer, the number is
          represented in decimal form as a Number 
          with no decimal point and no leading zeros,
          preceded by a minus sign (-) if the number
          is negative.
        - Otherwise the number is represented in 
          decimal form as a Number including a 
          decimal point with at least one digit
          before the decimal point and at least one
          digit after the decimal point, preceded by
          a minus sign (-) if the number is negative;
          there must be no leading zeros before the 
          decimal point apart possibly from the one
          required digit immediately before the
          decimal point; beyond the one required 
          digit after the decimal point there must 
          be as many, but only as many, more digits
          as are needed to uniquely distinguish the 
          number from all other IEEE 754 numeric 
          values.

      Return Value:
         The last evaluation result converted into a 
         WideString.  For invalid node-set results an
         empty WideString is returned.

  <title>XPath Result Classes</title>

  <para>The classes described in this section are internally used during XPath evaluation. They represent (intermediate) results of the evaluation of an XPath expression within the context of a particular node. All XPath result classes inherit from the common abstract base class TDomXPathCustomResult.  The class hierarchy of XPath result classes is as follows:</para>

  <literallayout><emphasis>
TPersistent
  |__ TDomXPathCustomResult
       |__ TDomXPathBooleanResult
       |__ TDomXPathNumberResult
       |__ TDomXPathNodeSetResult
       |__ TDomXPathStringResult
  </emphasis></literallayout>

  <para>There are two typical situations where an application directly needs to create and manipulate such classes: When an applications must handle a TDomImplementation.OnRequestXPathVariable or OnRequestXPathFunctionResult event. In both cases it must return a TDomXPathCustomResult descendant representing the value of an XPath variable or the result of a user-defined XPath function respectively.</para>
  
  <para>Note that applications must not directly use instances of TDomXPathCustomResult.  Instead use one of the classes derived from TDomXPathCustomResult.</para>


  <sect2>
  <title>TDomXPathCustomResult = class(TCustomOwnedObject)</title>

  <para>The TDomXPathCustomResult class is used as the common abstract base class for the specific XPath result classes.  Do not use instances of this class directly in your application. Instead use one of the classes derived from TDomXPathCustomResult.</para>

           round-to-nearest rule) to the mathematical 
           value represented by the string; any other 
           string is converted to NaN.
         - Boolean true is converted to 1; Boolean false 
           is converted to 0.
         - A node-set is first converted to a string as 
           if by a call to the XPath string() function 
           and then converted in the same way as a

         The XPath result converted to a WideString
         according to the XPath string() function
         as specified in [XPath 1.0], sec. 4.2:

         - A node-set is converted to a WideString by 
           returning the string-value of the node in the
           node-set that is first in document order. If 
           the node-set is empty, an empty WideString is 
           returned.
         - The Boolean False value is converted to the
           WideString 'False'. The Boolean True value 
           is converted to the string 'True'.
         - A number is converted to a WideString as 
           follows:
           - NaN is converted to the WideString 'NaN'.
           - Positive zero is converted to the 
             WideString '0'.
           - Negative zero is converted to the 
             WideString '0'.
           - Positive infinity is converted to the 
             WideString 'Infinity'.
           - Negative infinity is converted to the 
             WideString '-Infinity'.
           - If the number is an Integer, the number is
             represented in decimal form as a Number 
             with no decimal point and no leading zeros,
             preceded by a minus sign (-) if the number

             decimal form as a Number including a 
             decimal point with at least one digit
             before the decimal point and at least one
             digit after the decimal point, preceded by
             a minus sign (-) if the number is negative;
             there must be no leading zeros before the 
             decimal point apart possibly from the one
             required digit immediately before the
             decimal point; beyond the one required 
             digit after the decimal point there must 
             be as many, but only as many, more digits
             as are needed to uniquely distinguish the
