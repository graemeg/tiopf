libxml2-pas: libxml2 header translation for Pascal
libxslt-pas: libxslt header translation for Pascal

TODO
====
(sorted by importance):
- FreePascal compatibility (in progress)
- xmlXPathObject.boolval: find out if the translation is correct, or why it looks so strange
- complete translation of iconv.pas
- more examples
- complete testsuite for DUnit (skeleton should be generated from libxml2-api.xml
- error api: add a unit to make it easy to check&throw exceptions
- translate remaining macros in all units (e.g. xpathInternals)
- use libxml2-api.xml and libxslt-api.xml to check completeness of translation
- automate updates of inline doc (comments) - create a script
- generate actually defined(==turned on) DEFINE switches from the source

DONE
====
- translate also libexslt files
- make release process compatible with libxml part
- translate remaining libxslt files
- add JEDI info template
- the INFO.txt file is generated from INFO.txt.template, using script mkrelease
- FILE* arguments in some functions - translation corrected (reported by Robert Marquardt, Team JEDI)
- Delphi Memory Manager is used, which allowed also translation of xmlFree()
- autodetection of changes in header files in gnome-xml CVS base ('make checkapi')
- all header files translated
- Bjorn Reese modified libxml2 to not use SIGFPE which made many api functions to crash when called in Delphi programs
